Giuria 1, 10125 Torino Italy e-mail: pietro.fre@unito.it arXiv:2308.14022v1  [hep-th]  27 Aug 2023Abstract The present Lecture Notes have been prepared to back up a series of a few seminars given by the author at the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam. These Notes aim at reviewing a research project conducted over the last six years about a quite interesting and challenging topic, namely the use of the generalized Kronheimer construction and the generalized McKay correspondence for the crepant resolutionY Γ [3] → C3 Γ of orbifold singularities, Γ being s finite subgroup of SU(3), as a strategic tool to construct holographic dual pairs ofN = 1 gauge theories inD = 4 and D3-brane solutions of type IIB supergravity. The project, developed by Ugo Bruzzo with the present author, in various co-authorships with Massimo Bianchi, Anna Fino, Pietro Antonio Grassi, Dimitry Markushevich, Dario Martelli, Mario Trigiante and Umar Shahzad, is still going on and there are a lot of interesting unanswered questions that are illustrated throughout these Lecture Notes and particularly emphasized in its last chapter. The mathematical roots of this project are very robust and ramified in differential geometry, group theory and algebraic geometry. A particularly challenging issue is that of constructing Ricci flat metrics on the total space of line-bundles over compact K¨ahler manifolds of real dimension four. In that direction the symplectic action/angle formalism turns out to be a winning weapon. The ultimate goal is that of deducing all the aspects of holographic duality from finite group theory or, to be more precise, from the faithful embedding of abstract finite groups into SU(3).Contents

Hermann Nicolai to pay a two-week visit at the Albert Einstein Institut in Potsdam, where I volunteered to give some seminars/lectures, has offered me a precious and challenging opportunity to reconsider in an overall perspective a research project to which, over the last six years, I dedicated most of my energies in constant cooperation with another old time friend of mine and distinguished scientist, Prof. Ugo Bruzzo, through a series of papers written in various co-authorships including Professors Anna Fino, Dmitry Markushevich, Pietro Antonio Grassi, Massimo Bianchi, Dario Martelli and Mario Trigiante, more recently also Dr. Umar Shahzad. The expressions of my deepest gratitude go to all of them for what they taught me within the framework of our common work and for the nice results that we could derive together, last but not least, also for the pleasant friendly atmosphere of our constructive discussions. The topics to be reviewed in these lectures have a precise location in the wide mathematical-physics land- scape and are significantly characterized by their articulated roots in different branches of pure mathematics: algebraic complex geometry, differential geometry, finite group-theory, homology and cohomology. There is however, at the basis of the investigations, a hard core of inspiring ideas of theoretical physics nature, I might even say of philosophical nature, which developed within the framework of String/Supergravity/Brane Theory but have by now acquired a wider formulation, not necessarily point-wise tied to String Theory as such. These general ideas have three main components: A ) Holography and the Gauge/Gravity Correspondence . This is the idea that a quantum field theory living on the boundary ∂MST of some multi-dimensional space time, for instance the gauge theory describing all the non gravitational interactions that lives on the four-dimensional boundary of five-dimensional anti de Sitter space AdS5 might be ”solved” by means of classical geometrical calculations in the bulk MST. B) The breaking of conformal invariance of the gauge theory by the resolution of orbifold singularities. This is the development within Supergravity and String Theory of the consequences of the following chain of results piled up in the last four decades: 1. a way to break supersymmetry or other continuous symmetries is that of considering as substratum of exact solutions of (Super)-Gravity field equations, flat manifoldsMf lat quotiened by the action of a discrete group Γ, generically named orbifolds Mf lat/Γ. 2. The space Mf lat/Γ has singularities in the fixed points for the action of Γ on Mf lat and there are relevant operators that can deform the orbifold solution to one on a smooth manifold fMsmooth that, via the exceptional divisors introduced by the blowup morphism, develops non trivial homology and cohomology. 3. The size of such new homology cycles are dimensionful parameters that break conformal invariance and give rise to more realistic holographic pairs gauge-theory/gravitational solution. 4C) Tracing back physical theories to group structures. This is the guiding principle, physical and philosoph- ical that aims at reducing the Laws of Nature to Symmetry Principles. In its declination in the context of holography and orbifolds one would like to develop a robust conceptual setup in which the dual pairs and all of their aspects can be traced back to group structures. The robust conceptual setup that provides a rich play-ground for the theoretical physicist’s aspirations concisely described in point C) was created by mathematicians at the end of 1980.s in particular by Peter Kronheimer in [1, 2] with an essential input from the genial discoveries of John McKay [3]. The Kronheimer setup for the res- olution of the C2/Γ singularities where Γ ⊂ SU(2), resolution that produces the so named ALE-manifolds was very recent at the beginning of the years 1990 when I was newly appointed full-professor at SISSA and I had exceptionally brilliant Ph.D. students working under my supervision: in alphabetical order Damiano Anselmi, Marco Billo, Alberto Zaffaroni. It was Marco Billo who attracted my attention to Kronheimer results and the fascinating McKay correspondence between the ADE classification of simply laced simple Lie algebras and that of finite subgroups Γ ⊂ SO(3) of the rotation group. Together with Anselmi, Zaffaroni and our senior colleague Luciano Girardello, whom we all are missing very much, we immediately conceived the idea of applying the Kronheimer setup to two-dimensional field theories with N = 2 super-conformal symmetries [4]. Several other applications were produced in the same years by other authors, particulary in connection with gravitational and gauge instantons [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Few years later, when I had come back to Torino University from SISSA, dis- cussions with my former Ph.D. students, Matteo Bertolini and Mario Trigiante, motivated us to revise the use of ALE-manifolds and the Kronheimer construction for the errand of establishing exact D3-brane solutions of type IIB supergravity, preservingN = 2-supersymmetry. With other authors from G¨oteborg University we pub- lished the papers [10, 11] that can be seen as the ancestors of the research project reported in the present lectures. Indeed, although for many years I was involved in different activities and in different research directions, the drive towards the Kronheimer construction remained always in my mind and I always meant to come back to it at some point. By the year 2016, when I approached the end of my appointment as Scientific Counselor of the Italian Embassy in Moscow, I came to know a little bit about the several advances that the mathematical community had done, generalizing the Kronheimer construction to the case of the resolution of C3/Γ singular- ities where Γ ⊂ SU(3). I was quite seriously attracted by the topic and tried to read many papers. I was finally irreducibly seduced when I discovered the results of Roan [12] and I learned that in the classification of SU (3) finite subgroups achieved one century ago [13, 14], the order 168 simple group PSL (2,7) is the maximal non abelian one and that the resolution of the singularity C3/PSL(2,7) had already been done many years before by Markusevich in [15]. The group PSL (2,7) had been my concern in the previous two years in relation with solutions of D=11 supergravity on special T 7 torii obtained by quotiening R7 with lattices admitting PSL(2,7) as a crystallographic group [16]. Plunging into the study of the mathematical literature I soon realized that my education in algebraic geometry was almost evanescent and absolutely inadequate to master what I wanted to understand and possibly utilize in connection with M2-branes and D3-branes. So I called my old friend Ugo Bruzzo with whom, unfortunately, I had not been in contact for several years and I asked him if he was interested in joining me in an adventure where I had just only wishful thinking, while he solidly knew the way. Very generously he agreed and our collaboration started. We involved also Anna Fino, a brilliant recently appointed Full Professor of Differential Geometry of my own University with whom Ugo had already extensive contacts and, in one year time, we arrived at the publication of [17] which is the first step in the conceptual development that in these lectures I mean to review, entering now in medias res. Before doing that I want to warn my reader that, notwithstanding the achieved advances, which undoubtedly we did and which the number of pages of these Lecture Notes might suggest to be extensive, yet the road ahead is still long and the open questions are many more than the obtained answers. 51.1 Entering in medias res After the preliminary remarks that were provided in order to locate both historically and in the context of a long time perspective the problems and issues addressed in the reviewed research project, I finally enter inmedias res, namely in a more technically detailed account of what is the content of these Lecture Notes. I plan to report on the advances obtained on the following special aspect of the gauge/gravity correspondence, within the context of quiver gauge–theories [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]: the relevance of the generalized Kronheimer construction[17, 23, 24, 25] for the resolution of C3/Γ singularities. I begin with the general problem of establishing holographic dual pairs whose members are: A) a gauge theory living on a D3-brane world volume, B) a classical D3-brane solution of type IIB supergravity in D=10 supergravity. Gauge theories based on quiver diagrams have been extensively studied in the literature in connection with the problem of establishing such holographic dual pairs as described above. Indeed the quiver diagram is a powerful tool which encodes the data of a K ¨ahler quotient describing the geometry of the six directions transverse to the brane. Here I will be concerned with the mathematical aspects of the dual holographic pairs. In particular the following statement will be thoroughly illustrated: Statement 1.1.1 There is a one-to-one map between the field-content and the interaction structure of a D = 4, N = 1 Gauge Theory on the D3-brane world volume and the generalized Kronheimer algorithm of solving quotient singularities C3/Γ via a K¨ahler quotient based on the McKay correspondence. All items on both sides of the one-to-one correspondence are completely determined by the structure of the finite group Γ and by its specific embedding into SU(3). An ultra short summary of the results that I am going to present is the following. From the field–theoretic side the essential items defining the theory are: 1. The K ¨ahler manifold S spanned by the Wess-Zumino multiplets. This is the 3 |Γ| dimensional mani- fold SΓ = HomΓ (Q⊗R,R) where Q is the representation of Γ inside SU(3) and R denotes the regular representation of the discrete group. 2. The gauge group FΓ. This latter is identified as the maximal compact subgroupFΓ of the complex quiver group GΓ of complex dimension |Γ|− 1, to be discussed later. Since the action of FΓ on SΓ is defined by construction, the gauge interactions of the Wess-Zumino multiplets are also fixed and the associated moment maps are equally uniquely determined. 3. The Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. These are in a one-to-one association with the ζ levels of the moment maps corresponding to the center of the gauge Lie algebra z[FΓ]1. The dimension of this center is r which is the number of nontrivial conjugacy classes of the discrete group Γ and also of its nontrivial irreps. 4. The superpotential WΓ. This latter is a cubic function uniquely associated with a quadratic constraint [A,B] = [B,C] = [C,A] =0 which characterizes the generalized Kronheimer construction, defines a K¨ahler subvariety V|Γ|+2 ⊂ SΓ and admits a universal group theoretical description in terms of the quiver group GΓ. 5. In presence of all the above items the manifold of vacua of the gauge theory, namely of extrema at zero of its scalar potential, is just the minimal crepant resolution of the singularity MΓ → C3 Γ , obtained as K¨ahler quotient of V|Γ|+2 with respect to the gauge group FΓ. 1In this paper we follow the convention that the names of the Lie groups are denoted with calligraphic letters F,G,U , the corre- sponding Lie algebras being denoted by mathbb letters F,G,U. 66. The Dolbeault cohomology of the space of vacua MΓ is predicted by the finite group Γ structure in terms of a grading of its conjugacy classes named age grading. The construction of the homology cycles and exceptional divisors that are Poincar ´e dual to such cohomology classes is the most exciting issue in the present list of geometry ⇐ ⇒field theory correspondences, liable to give rise to many interesting phys- ical applications. In this context a central item is the notion of tautological bundles associated with the nontrivial irreps of Γ that we discuss at length in the sequel [26]. Indeed within the general scope of quivers a special subclass is that ofMcKay quivers that are group theoretically defined by the embedding of a finite discrete group Γ in an n-dimensional complex unitary group Γ ,→ SU(n) (1.1.1) and are associated with the resolution ofCn/Γ quotient singularities by means of a Kronheimer-like construction [1, 2, 4]. The case n = 2 corresponds to the HyperK ¨ahler quotient construction of ALE-manifolds as the resolution of the C2/Γ singularities, the discrete group Γ being a finite Kleinian subgroup of SU (2), as given by the ADE classification2. The case n = 3 was the target of many interesting and robust mathematical developments starting from the middle of the nineties up to the present day [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 26]. The main and most intriguing result in this context, which corresponds to a generalization of the Kronheimer construction and of the McKay correspondence, is the group theoretical prediction of the cohomology groups H(p,q) \u0010 Y Γ [3] \u0011 of the crepant smooth resolution Y Γ [3] of the quotient singularity C3/Γ. Specifically, the main output of the generalized Kronheimer construction for the crepant resolution of a singularity C3/Γ is a blowdown morphism: BD : Y Γ [3] − →C3 Γ (1.1.2) where Y Γ [3] is a noncompact smooth three-fold with trivial canonical bundle. On such a complex three-fold a Ricci-flat K¨ahler metric ds2 RFK(Y Γ [3]) =gRFK αβ ⋆ dyα ⊗dyβ⋆ (1.1.3) with asymptotically conical boundary conditions (Quasi-ALE) is guaranteed to exist (see e.g. [36], Thm. 3.3), although it is not necessarily the one obtained by means of the K¨ahler quotient. According to the theorem proved by Ito-Reid [28, 31, 32] and based on the concept of age grading 3, the homology cycles of Y Γ [3] are all algebraic and its non vanishing cohomology groups are all even and of type H (q,q). We actually have a correspondence between the cohomology classes of type (q,q) and the discrete group conjugacy classes with age-grading q, encoded in the statement: dimH1,1 \u0010 Y Γ [3] \u0011 = # of junior conjugacy classes in Γ; dimH2,2 \u0010 Y Γ [3] \u0011 = # of senior conjugacy classes in Γ; all other cohomology groups are trivial (1.1.4) The absence of harmonic forms of type(2,1) implies that the three-foldsY Γ [3] admit no infinitesimal deformations of their complex structure and is also a serious obstacle, as we discuss in section 2.2 to the construction of supergravity D3-brane solutions based on Y Γ [3] that have transverse three-form fluxes. 2For a recent review of these matters see chapter 8 of [27]. 3For a recent review of these matters within a general framework of applications to brane gauge theories see [17, 23]. 71.1.1 A special class of N = 1,D = 4 gauge theories In the realization of the one-to-one map advocated in statement 1.1.1, we are interested in theories where the Wess-Zumino multiplets are identified with the non-vanishing entries of a triple of matrices, named A,B,C, and the superpotential takes the following form: W = const × Tr(A[B,C])+ Tr(B[C,A])+ Tr(C [A,B]) = 3const × (Tr(ABC )−Tr(AC B)) (1.1.5) Because of the positive-definiteness of the K ¨ahler metric gi j⋆ and of the Killing metric mΛΣ the zero of the potential, namely the vacua, are characterized by the two conditions: ∂iW = 0 ⇒ [A,B] = [B,C] = [C,A] =0 (1.1.6) PΛ = ζI CI Λ (1.1.7) which will have a distinctive interpretation in the K ¨ahler quotient construction `a la Kronheimer. Notice that CI Λ denotes the projector of the gauge Lie algebra onto its center, as we already said. 8Chapter 2 The Generalized Kronheimer construction and McKay correspondence for Cn/Γ singularities In this chapter I review the main aspects of the Generalized Kronheimer construction just listed in the introduc- tory chapter and the construction of D3-brane solutions based on it. 2.1 On superconformal gauge theories dual to D3-brane classical solutions In this short section we collect some issues and hints relative to the construction of superconformal gauge theories dual to orbifolds of the D3-brane transverse space with respect to Γ ⊂ SU(3). The most important conclusion is that, as long as we require the existence of a complex structure ofR6 compatible with PSL(2,7)1, we reduce the singularity to: C3 Γ ; Γ ⊂ SU(3) (2.1.1) As it is well known SU(4)-gauged supergravity is obtained from d=10 type IIB supergravity compactified on: AdS5 ×S5 (2.1.2) which is the near horizon geometry of a D3-brane with R6 transverse space. Indeed R6 is the metric cone on S5. The entire Kaluza-Klein spectrum which constitutes the spectrum of BPS operators of the d=4 theory is organized in short representations of the supergroup: SU(2,2|4) (2.1.3) Our discussion leads to the conclusion that we can consider the compactification of supergravity on orbifolds of the following type: CΓS5 = S5 Γ ; Γ ⊂ SU(3) ⊂ SO(6) ∼ SO(4) (2.1.4) The corresponding D3-brane solution has the orbifold: CΓR6 = R6 Γ (2.1.5) 1Following the notations of [16] by PSL(2,7) we denote the simple group of order 168 that is isomorphic with PSL (2,7) and which is also the largest non abelian non solvable finite subgroup of SU(3), according with the classification of [13, 14]. 9as transverse space. The massive and massless modes of the Kalauza Klein spectrum are easily worked out from the SU (2,2|4) spectrum of the 5-sphere. Indeed since the group Γ is embedded by the above construction into SU (4) ⊂ SU(2,2|4), it suffices to cut the spectrum to the Γ singlets. 2.1.1 Quotient singularities and gauge groups What we said above can be summarized by saying that we construct models where D3-branes are probing the singularity (2.1.5) and we might be interested in the smooth manifold obtained by blowing up the latter. In order to derive the dual superconformal field theory it is essential to specify the embedding of Γ into the isometry group SU(4) of the five-sphere. Different embeddings of the same discrete group can lead to different gauge theories on the world volume. 2.1.2 Some suggestions from ALE manifolds Some useful suggestions on this conceptual link can arise by comparing with the case of well known singularities like C2/Γ, the discrete group Γ being one of the finite subgroups of SU (2) falling into the ADE classification. In that case the blowup of the singularities can be done by means of a hyperK ¨ahler quotient according to the Kronheimer construction [1, 2]. Essentially the gauge group is to be identified with the nonabelian extension U(1) → U(N) of the group F one utilizes in the hyperK ¨ahler quotient. The group FΓ is a product of U (1)’s as long as the discrete group Γ is the cyclic group Zk, yet it becomes nonabelian with factors SU (k) when Γ is nonabelian. As far as we know no one has constructed gauge theories corresponding to D3-branes that probe singularities of the type C×C2/Γ with a nonabelian Γ. This case might be a ground-zero case to investigate. 2.1.3 Moduli of the blowup and superconformal operators: inspirations from geometry It must be stressed that in the spectrum of the conformal field theory obtained at the orbifold point (which corresponds to the Kaluza Klein spectrum in the case of smooth manifolds) there must be those associated with the moduli of the blowup. By similarity with the case of superstrings at orbifold points, we expect that these are twisted states, namely states not visible in the Kaluza Klein spectrum on the orbifold. Yet when the orbifold is substituted with its smooth counterpart, obtained blowing up the singularity, these states should appear as normal states in the supergravity Kaluza Klein spectrum. 2.1.4 Temporary conclusion The above discussion shows that the embedding of Γ is fundamental. We can treat PSL(2,7) ≡ PSL(2,Z7) and other discrete group Γ singularities when Γ has a holomorphic action on C3. This happens when Γ ⊂ SU(3) ⊂ SU(4) (2.1.6) In this case the singularity is just C3/Γ and C3/PSL(2,7) is the blowup described by Markushevich in [15]. We mention it again in a later section. The classification of discrete subgroups of SL (3,C) was achieved at the dawn of the XXth century in [13, 14]. The largest non-abelian nontrivial group appearing in this classification is the unique simple group with 168 elements named PSL(2,7) (see [16] and [37] for a thorough discussion). The other possibilities are provided by a finite list of cyclic and solvable groups reviewed for instance in [29]. 2.1.5 Quotient singularities and D3-branes We come now to the mathematics which is of greatest interest to us in order to address the physical problem at stake, i.e., the construction of D=4 gauge theories dual to D3-branes that have the metric cone on orbifoldsS5/Γ 10as transverse space. The first step is to show that such metric cone is justC3/Γ. This is a rather simple fact but it is of the utmost relevance since it constitutes the very bridge between the mathematics of quotient singularities, together with their resolutions, and the physics of gauge theories. The pivot of this bridge is the complex Hopf fibration of the 5-sphere. The argument leading to the above conclusion was provided in the paper [38] and we do not deem it necessary to repeat it here. We just jump to the conclusion there reached. The spaceC3 −{0} can be regarded as the total space of the canonical C⋆-fibration over P2: π : C3 −{0} →P2 ∀y ∈ P2 : π−1(y) ∼ C⋆ (2.1.7) By restricting to the unit sphere in C3 we obtain the Hopf fibration of the seven sphere: π : S5 → P2 ∀y ∈ P2 : π−1(y) ∼ S1 (2.1.8) The consequence of such a discussion is that if we have a finite subgroup Γ ⊂ SU(3), which obviously is an isometry of P2, we can consider its action both on P2 and on the seven sphere so that we have: AdS5 × S5 Γ → ∂AdS5 × C3 Γ (2.1.9) We are therefore interested in describing the theory of D3-branes probing the singularity C3 Γ . Hence an impor- tant guiding line in addressing mathematical questions comes from their final use in connection with D3-brane solutions of D = 10 type IIB supergravity and with the construction of quantum gauge theories dual to such D3-solutions of supergravity. Recalling the results of [38] we start from the following diagram K2 π← −M5 Cone ,→ K3 A ,→ Vq (2.1.10) where M5 is the compact manifold on which D=10 type IIB supergravity is compactified and Vq denotes some appropriate algebraic variety of complex dimension q. It is required that M5 should be a Sasakian manifold. What Sasakian means is visually summarized in the following table. base of the fibration projection 5-manifold inclusion metric cone B4 π← − M5 ,→ C (M5) ⇕ ∀ p ∈ B4 π−1(p) ∼ S1 ⇕ ⇕ K¨ahler K2 Sasakian K ¨ahler Ricci flat K3 First of all the M5 manifold must admit an S1-fibration over a K¨ahler two-fold K2: π : M5 S1 − →K2 (2.1.11) Calling zi the three complex coordinates of K2 and χ the angle spanning S1, the fibration means that the metric of M5 admits the following representation: ds2 M5 = (dχ −A )2 + gi j⋆ dzi ⊗dzj⋆ (2.1.12) where the one–form A is some suitable connection one–form on the U(1)-bundle (2.1.11). Secondly the metric cone C (M5) over the manifold M5 defined by the direct product R+ ×M5 equipped 11with the following metric: ds2 C(M5) = dr2 +4e2 r2 ds2 M5 (2.1.13) should also be a Ricci-flat complex K¨ahler 3-fold. In the above equatione just denotes a constant scale parameter with the dimensions of an inverse length [e] =ℓ−1. Altogether the Ricci flat K¨ahler manifold K3, which plays the role of transverse space to the D3-branes, is a line bundle over the base manifold K2: π : K3 − →K2 ∀p ∈ K2 π−1(p) ∼ C (2.1.14) The fundamental geometrical clue to the field content of the superconformal gauge theory on the boundary is provided by the construction of the K ¨ahler manifold K3 as a holomorphic algebraic variety in some higher dimensional affine or projective space Vq, plus a K¨ahler quotient. The equations identifying the algebraic locus in Vq are related with the superpotential W appearing in the d = 4 lagrangian, while the K ¨ahler quotient is related with the D-terms appearing in the same lagrangian. The coordinates uα of the space Vq are the scalar fields of the superconformal gauge theory, whose vacua, namely the set of extrema of its scalar potential, should be in a one–to–one correspondence with the points of K3. Going from one to multiple D3–branes just means that the coordinates zi of Vq acquire color indices under a proper set of color gauge groups and are turned into matrices. In this way we obtain quivers. This is the main link between the D=4 dual gauge theories and the geometry of the transverse space to the branes. The AdS5 compactification of D = 10 supergravity is obtained by utilizing as complementary 5-dimensional space a manifold M5 which occupies the above displayed position in the inclusion–projection diagram (2.1.10). The metric cone C(M5) enters the game when, instead of looking at the vacuum: AdS5 ⊗M5 (2.1.15) we consider the more general D3-brane solutions of D=10 supergravity, where the D=10 metric is of the follow- ing form: ds2 10 = H(y)−1 2 \u0000 dxµ ⊗dxνηµν \u0001 −H(y) 1 2 \u0000 ds2 M6 \u0001 (2.1.16) ηµν being the constant Lorentz metric of Mink1,2 and: ds2 M6 = dyI ⊗dyJ gIJ (y) (2.1.17) being a Ricci-flat metric on an asymptotically locally Euclidean 6-manifold M6. In eqn. (2.1.16) the symbol H(y) denotes a harmonic function over the manifold M6, namely: 2gH(y) =0 (2.1.18) Eq. (2.1.18) is the only differential constraint required in order to satisfy all the field equations of D = 10 su- pergravity in presence of the standard D3-brain ansatz that we detail later on (see eqn.s 2.2.2). In this more general setup the manifold M6 is what substitutes the metric cone C(M5). To see the connection between the two viewpoints it suffices to introduce the radial coordinate r(y) by means of the position: H(y) =1 − 1 r(y)4 (2.1.19) The asymptotic region whereM6 is required to be locally Euclidean is defined by the conditionr(y) → ∞. In this 12limit the metric (2.1.17) should approach the flat Euclidean metric ofR6 ≃C3. The opposite limit wherer(y) →0 defines the near horizon region of the D3-brane solution. In this region the metric (2.1.16) it is tacitly assumed that it should approach that of the space (2.1.15), the manifoldM5 being a codimension one submanifold of M6 defined by the limit r → 0. As we will see in chapter 5 this assumption is not necessarily verified. It can happen that there is no inter- mediate Sasaki Einstein manifold M5 and that in the limit r → 0 the Ricci flat metric on M5 simply flows to the 4-dimensional metric of the base manifold M4 ∼ K2, the M6 Ricci flat manifold being a line bundle on K2. To be mathematically more precise let us consider the harmonic function as a map: H : M6 → R+ (2.1.20) This view point introduces a foliation of M6 into a one-parameter family of 5-manifolds: ∀h ∈ R+ : M5(h) ≡ H−1(h) ⊂ M6 (2.1.21) The tacit assumption that is not necessarily verified is that each manifoldM5(h) is isometrical to any other of the same family, meaning that the metric on eachM5(h) is the same abstract metric. This is not necessarily true. For each h the metric can be deformed, having different Weyl and Ricci tensors in intrinsic components. We show that in one of the calculable examples we were able to analyse, this is exactly what happens. Independently from that, in order to have the possibility of residual supersymmetries we are interested in cases where the Ricci flat manifold M6 is actually a Ricci-flat K¨ahler 3-fold. When an intermediate Sasaki-Einstein manifold M5 does exist the appropriate rewriting of eqn. (2.1.10) is as follows: K2 π← −M5 H−1 ← −K3 A ,→ Vq (2.1.22) Next we outline a general pattern laid down that will be our starting point. The N = 4 case with no singularities. The prototype of the above inclusion–projection diagram is provided by the case of the D3-brane solution with all preserved supersymmetries. In this case we have: P2 π← −S5 Cone ,→ C3 A =Id ,→ C3 (2.1.23) On the left we just have the projection map of the Hopf fibration of the 5-sphere. On the right we have the inclusion map of the 5 sphere in its metric cone C(S5) ≡ R6 ∼ C3. The last algebraic inclusion map is just the identity map, since the algebraic variety C3 is already smooth and flat and needs no extra treatment. The singular orbifold cases. The next orbifold cases are those of interest to us in these lectures. LetΓ ⊂ SU(3) be a finite discrete subgroup of SU(3). Then eqn. (2.1.23) might be replaced by the following one: P2 Γ π← −S5 Γ Cone ,→ C3 Γ A =?,→ ? (2.1.24) The consistency of the above quotient is guaranteed by the inclusion SU (3) ⊂ SU(4). The question marks can be removed only by separating the two cases: A) Case: Γ ⊂ SU(2) ⊂ S(U(1)⊗U(2)) ⊂ SU(3). Here we obtain: C3 Γ ≃ C× C2 Γ (2.1.25) 13and everything is under full control for the Kleinian C2 Γ singularities and their resolution `a la Kronheimer in terms of hyperK¨ahler quotients. B) Case: Γ ⊂ SU(3). Here we obtain: C3 Γ = not reducible to a product of two varieties (2.1.26) and the study and resolution of the singularityC3 Γ in a physicist friendly way is the main issue of the present lectures. The comparison of case B) with the well known case A) will provide us with many important hints. Let us begin by erasing the question marks in case A). Here we can write: P2 Γ π← −S5 Γ Cone ,→ C× C2 Γ Id×AW ,→ C×C3 (2.1.27) In the first inclusion map on the right, Id denotes the identity map C → C while AW denotes the inclusion of the orbifold C2 Γ as a singular variety in C3 cut out by a single polynomial constraint: AW : C2 Γ → V(IW Γ ) ⊂ C3 C[V(IΓ)] = C[u,w,z] WΓ(u,w,z) (2.1.28) where by C[V(IΓ)] we denote the coordinate ring of the algebraic variety V. As we recall in more detail in the next section, the variables u,w,z are polynomial Γ-invariant functions of the coordinates z1,z2 on which Γ acts linearly. The unique generator WΓ(u,w,z) of the ideal IW Γ which cuts out the singular variety isomorphic to C2 Γ is the unique algebraic relation existing among such invariants. In the next sections we discuss the relation between this algebraic equation and the embedding in higher dimensional algebraic varieties associated with the McKay quiver and the hyperK¨ahler quotient. Let us now consider the case B). Up to this level things go in a quite analogous way with respect to case A). Indeed we can write P2 Γ π← −S5 Γ Cone ,→ C3 Γ AW ,→ C4 (2.1.29) In the last inclusion map on the right, AW denotes the inclusion of the orbifold C3 Γ as a singular variety in C4 cut out by a single polynomial constraint: AW : C3 Γ → V(IΓ) ⊂ C4 C[V(IΓ)] ∼ C[u1,u2,u3,u4] WΓ(u1,u2,u3,u4) (2.1.30) Indeed as we show in later sections for the case Γ = PSL(2,7), discussed by Markushevich, and for all of its subgroups2, including Γ = G21 ⊂ PSL(2,7), the variables u1,u2,u3,u4 are polynomial Γ-invariant functions of the coordinates z1,z2,z3 on which Γ acts linearly. The unique generator WΓ(u1,u2,u3,u4) of the ideal IΓ which cuts out the singular variety isomorphic to C3 Γ is the unique algebraic relation existing among such invariants. As 2The group PSL (2,7) has three maximal subgroups, up to conjugation, namely two non conjugate copies of the octahedral group O24 ∼ S4 and one non abelian group of order 21, denoted G21 that is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z3 ⋉Z7. 14for the relation of this algebraic equation with the embedding in higher dimensional algebraic varieties associated with the McKay quiver, things are now more complicated. As already anticipated in the introductory section, in the years 1990s up to 2010s there has been an intense activity in the mathematical community on the issue of the crepant resolutions of C3/Γ (see for instance[39, 31, 15, 12]) that went on almost unnoticed by physicists since it was mostly formulated in the abstract language of algebraic geometry, providing few clues to the applicability of such results to gauge theories and branes. Yet, once translated into more explicit terms, by making use of coordinate patches, and equipped with some additional ingredients of Lie group character, these mathematical results turn out to be not only useful, but rather of outmost relevance for the physics of D3-branes. In the present lectures I aim at drawing the consistent, systematic scheme which emerges in this context upon a proper interpretation of the mathematical constructions (see in particular [17, 23, 24, 25]). So let us consider the case of smooth resolutions. In case A) the smooth resolution is provided by a manifold ALEΓ and we obtain the following diagram: M5 H−1 ← −C×ALEΓ Id×qK ← − C×V|Γ|+1 AP ,→ C×C2|Γ| (2.1.31) In the above equation the map H−1 ← −denotes the inverse of the harmonic function map on C×ALEΓ that we have already discussed. The map Id×qK ← −is instead the product of the identity map Id : C → C with the K¨ahler quotient map: qK : V|Γ|+1 − →V|Γ|+1 / /K F|Γ|−1 ≃ ALEΓ (2.1.32) of an algebraic variety of complex dimension|Γ|+1 with respect to a suitable Lie groupF|Γ|−1 of real dimension |Γ| −1. Finally the map AP ,→ denotes the inclusion map of the variety V|Γ|+1 in C2|Γ|. Let y1,... y2|Γ| be the coordinates of C2|Γ|. The variety V|Γ|+1 is defined by an ideal generated by |Γ|− 1 quadratic generators: V|Γ|+1 = V(IΓ) C[V(IΓ)] = C \u0002 y1,... y2|Γ| \u0003 \u0000 P1(y),P2(y),..., P|Γ|−1(y) \u0001 (2.1.33) Actually the |Γ|− 1 polynomials Pi(y) are the holomorphic part of the triholomorphic moment maps associated with the triholomorphic action of the group F|Γ|−1 on C2|Γ| and the entire procedure from C2|Γ| to ALEΓ can be seen as the hyperK¨ahler quotient: ALEΓ = C2|Γ|/ /HK F|Γ|−1 (2.1.34) yet we have preferred to split the procedure into two steps in order to compare case A) with case B) where the two steps are necessarily distinct and separated. Indeed in case B) we can write the following diagram: M5 H−1 ← −Y Γ [3] qK ← −V|Γ|+2 AP ,→ C3|Γ| (2.1.35) In this case, just as in the previous one, the intermediate step is provided by the K ¨ahler quotient but the map on the extreme right AP ,→ denotes the inclusion map of the variety V|Γ|+2 in C3|Γ|. Let y1,... y3|Γ| be the coordinates of C3|Γ|. The variety V|Γ|+2 is defined as the principal branch of a set of quadratic algebraic equations that are group-theoretically defined. Altogether the mentioned construction singles out the holomorphic orbit of a certain group action to be discussed in detail in the sequel. So we anticipate: V|Γ|+2 = DΓ ≡ OrbitGΓ (LΓ) (2.1.36) 15where both the set LΓ and the complex group GΓ are completely defined by the discrete group Γ defining the quotient singularity. 2.2 D3-brane supergravity solutions on resolved C3/Γ singularities An apparently general property of the complex three-foldsY Γ [3] that emerge from the crepant resolution construc- tion, when there is at least one senior classand therefore at least one compact component of the exceptional divisor is the following. The non-compactY Γ [3] corresponds to the total space of some line-bundle over a complex two-dimensional compact base manifold MB: Y Γ [3] π− →MB (2.2.1) According with this structure we name u,v,w the three complex coordinates of Y Γ [3], u,v being the coordinates of the base manifold MB and w being the coordinate spanning the fibres. We will use the same names also in more general cases even if the interpretation of w as a fibre coordinate will be lost. Hence we have: yyy ≡ yα = {u,v,w} ; yyy ≡ yα = {u,v,w} (2.2.2) An important observation which ought to be done right at the beginning is that other K ¨ahler metrics bgαβ ⋆ do exist on the three-fold Y[3] that are not Ricci-flat, although the cohomology class of the associated K ¨ahler form bK can be the same as the cohomology class of KRFK. Within the framework of the generalized Kronheimer construction, among such K ¨ahler (non-Ricci flat) metrics we have the one determined by the K ¨ahler quotient according to the formula of Hithchin, Karlhede, Lindstr¨om and Roˇcek [40]. Indeed, as we show later in explicit examples, the K¨ahler metric: ds2 HKLR(Y[3]) =gHKLR αβ ⋆ dyα ⊗dyβ⋆ (2.2.3) which emerges from the mathematical K ¨ahler quotient construction and which is naturally associated with Y[3] when this latter is interpreted as the space of classical vacua of the D3-brane gauge theory (set of extrema of the scalar potential), is generically non Ricci-flat. On the other hand on the supergravity side of the dual D3-brane pair we need the Ricci-flat metric in order to construct a bona-fide D3-brane solution of type IIB supergravity. In particular, callingY Γ [3] the crepant resolution of the C3/Γ singularity, admitting a Ricci-flat metric, we can construct a bona-fide D3 brane solution which is solely defined by a single real function H on Y Γ [3], that should be harmonic with respect to the Ricci-flat metric, namely: 2gRFK H = 0 (2.2.4) Indeed the function H(y) is necessary and sufficient to introduce a flux of the Ramond 5-form so as to produce the splitting of the 10-dimensional space into a 4-dimensional world volume plus a transverse 6-dimensional space that is identified with the three-fold Y Γ [3]. This is the very essence of the D3-picture. Yet there is another essential item that was pioneered in [11, 10], namely the consistent addition of fluxes for the complex 3-forms H± that appear in the field content of type IIB supergravity. These provide relevant new charges on both sides of the gauge/gravity correspondence. In [11, 10] such fluxes were constructed explicitely relying on the special kind of three-fold: Y[3] = Y[1+2] = C×ALEΓ (2.2.5) constructed by Kronheimer [1, 2] and mentioned above as case A. As we explain in detail below, the essential geometrical feature ofY[3], required to construct consistent fluxes of the complex 3-forms H±, is that Y[3] should admit imaginary (anti)-self-dual, harmonic 3-forms Ω(2,1), which 16means: ⋆gRFK Ω(2,1) = ±iΩ(2,1) (2.2.6) and simultaneously: dΩ(2,1) = 0 ⇒ d ⋆gRFK Ω(2,1) = 0 (2.2.7) Since the Hodge-duality operator involves the use of a metric, we have been careful in specifying that (anti)- self-duality should occur with respect to the Ricci-flat metric that is the one used in the rest of the supergravity solution construction. The reason why the choice (2.2.5) of the three-fold allows the existence of harmonic anti-self dual 3-forms is easily understood recalling that the ALEΓ-manifold obtained from the resolution of C2/Γ has a compact support cohomology group of type (1,1) of the following dimension: dimH(1,1) comp (ALEΓ) =r where r = # of nontrivial conjugacy classes of Γ (2.2.8) Naming z ∈ C the coordinate on the factor C of the product (2.2.5) and ω(1,1) I a basis of harmonic anti-self dual one-forms on ALEΓ, the ansatz utilized in [11, 10] to construct the required Ω(2,1) was the following: Ω(2,1) ≡ ∂z fI(z)dz ∧ ω(1,1) I (2.2.9) where fI(z) is a set of holomorphic functions of that variable. As it is well known r is also the rank of the corresponding Lie Algebra in the ADE-classification of the corresponding Kleinian groups and the 2-forms ω(1,1) I can be chosen dual to a basis of homology cycles CI spanning H2 (ALEΓ), namely we can set: Z CI ω(1,1) J = δIJ (2.2.10) The form Ω(2,1) is closed by construction: dΩ(2,1) = 0 (2.2.11) and it is also anti-selfdual with respect to the Ricci-flat metric: ds2 Y[1+2] = dz ⊗dz + ds2 ALEΓ (2.2.12) Hence the question whether we can construct sufficiently flexible D3-solutions of supergravity with both 5-form and 3-form fluxes depends on the nontriviality of the relevant cohomology group: dimH(2,1) \u0000 Y[3] \u0001 > 0 (2.2.13) and on our ability to find harmonic (anti)-self dual representatives of its classes (typically not with compact support and hence non normalizable). At this level we find a serious difficulty that was already mentioned in the introductory section 1.1. In- deed it appears that we are not able to find the required Ω(2,1) forms on Y Γ [3] and that no D3-brane supergravity solution with 3-form fluxes can be constructed dual to the gauge theory obtained from the Kronheimer construc- tion dictated by Γ ⊂ SU(3). Fortunately, the sharp conclusion encoded in eqn. (1.1.4) follows from a hidden mathematical assumption that, in physical jargon, amounts to a rigid universal choice of the holomorphic super- potential W (Φ). Under appropriate conditions that in collaboration with Massimo Bianchi it is was planned to explain in a future publication not yet accomplished and which are detectable at the level of the McKay quiver diagram, the superpotential can be deformed ( mass deformation), yielding a family of three-folds Y Γ,µ [3] which flow, for limiting values of the parameter (µ → µ0) to a three-fold Y Γ,µ0 [3] admitting imaginary anti self-dual har- monic (2,1)-forms. Since the content and the interactions of the gauge theory are dictated by the McKay quiver 17of Γ and by its associated Kronheimer construction, we are entitled to see its mass deformed version and the exact D3-brane supergravity solution built on Y Γ,µ0 [3] as dual to each other. This, as I already said, will be the object of a future work, which unfortunately for various reasons including the recent pandemia has been on hold for a couple of years. This being said, I begin with an accurate mathematical summary of the construction of D3-brane solutions of type IIB supergravity using the geometric formulation of the latter (see a pedagogical summary in [41] second volume chapter 6, section 6.8) obtained within the rheonomy framework [42]. 2.2.1 Geometric formulation of Type IIB supergravity In order to discuss conveniently the D3 brane solutions of type IIB that have as transverse space the crepant resolution of a C3/Γ singularity, we have to recall the geometric Free Differential Algebra formulation of the chiral ten dimensional theory fixing with care all our conventions, which is not only a matter of notations but also of principles and geometrical insight. Indeed the formulation of type IIB supergravity as it appears in string theory textbooks [43, 44] is tailored for the comparison with superstring amplitudes and is quite appropriate to this goal. Yet, from the viewpoint of the general geometrical set up of supergravity theories this formulation is somewhat unwieldy. Specifically it neither makes the SU(1,1)/U(1) coset structure of the theory manifest, nor does it relate the supersymmetry transformation rules to the underlying algebraic structure which, as in all other instances of supergravities, is a simple and well defined Free Differential algebra. The Free Differential Algebra of type IIB supergravity was singled out many years ago by Castellani in [45] and the geometric, manifestly SU(1,1)–covariant formulation of the theory was constructed by Castellani and Pesando in [46]. Their formulae and their transcription from a complex SU(1,1) basis to a real SL(2,R) basis were summarized and thoroughly explained in the dedicated section of the book [41] quoted above which I refer the reader to. 2.2.2 The D3-brane solution with a Y[3] transverse manifold In this section I discuss a D3-brane solution of type IIB supergravity in which, transverse to the brane world- manifold, we place a smooth non compact three-fold Y[3] endowed with a Ricci-flat K¨ahler metric. The ansatz for the D3-brane solution is characterized by two kinds of flux; in addition to the usual RR 5-form flux, there might be as we discussed above a non-trivial flux of the supergravity complex 3-form field strengths H±. Let us separate the ten coordinates of space-time into the following subsets: xM = ( xµ : µ = 0,1,2,3 coordinates of the 3-brane world volume yτ : τ = 4,5,6,7,8,9 real coordinates of the Y variety (2.2.1) The D3 brane ansatz We make the following ansatz for the metric: ds2 [10] = H(yyy,yyy)−1 2 \u0000 −ηµν dxµ ⊗dxν\u0001 +H(yyy,yyy) 1 2 \u0010 gRFK αβ ⋆ dyα ⊗dyβ⋆ \u0011 ds2 Y = gRFK αβ ⋆ dyα ⊗dyβ⋆ det(g[10]) = H(yyy,yyy)det(gRFK) ηµν = diag(+,−,−,−) (2.2.2) where gRFK is the K¨ahler metric of the Y[3] manifold gRFK αβ = ∂α ∂β K RFK (yyy,yyy) (2.2.3) 18the real function K RFK (yyy,yyy) being a suitable K¨ahler potential. Elaboration of the ansatz In terms of vielbein the ansatz (2.2.2) corresponds to V A = ( V a = H(yyy,yyy)−1/4 dxa a = 0,1,2,3 V ℓ = H(yyy,yyy)1/4 eℓ ℓ = 4,5,6,7,8,9 (2.2.4) where eℓ are the sechsbein 1-forms of the manifold Y[3] of real dimension six. The structure equations of the latter are3: 0 = d ei − bωi j ∧ ek ηjk bRi j = d bωi j − bωik ∧ bωℓ j ηkℓ = bRi j ℓm eℓ ∧ em (2.2.5) The relevant property of the Y[3] metric that we use in solving Einstein equations is that it is Ricci-flat: bRim ℓm = 0 (2.2.6) What we need in order to derive our solution and discuss its supersymmetry properties is the explicit form of the spin connection for the full 10-dimensional metric (2.2.2) and the corresponding Ricci tensor. From the torsion equation one can uniquely determine the solution: ωab = 0 ωaℓ = 1 4 H−3/2 dxaηℓk ∂k H ωℓm = bωℓm +∆ωℓm ; ∆ωℓm = −1 2 H−1 e[ℓ ηm]k ∂kH (2.2.7) Inserting this result into the definition of the curvature 2-form we obtain4: Ra b = −1 8 h H−3/22g H −H−5/2 ∂kH∂kH i δa b Ra ℓ = 0 Rm ℓ = 1 8H−3/22gHδm ℓ − 1 8H−5/2∂sH∂sHδm ℓ + 1 4H−5/2∂ℓH∂mH (2.2.8) where for any function f (yyy,yyy) with support on Y[3]: 2g f (yyy,yyy) = 1√detg \u0010 ∂α \u0010p detg gαβ ⋆ ∂β⋆ f \u0011\u0011 (2.2.9) denotes the action on it of the Laplace–Beltrami operator with respect to the metric (2.2.3) which is the Ricci-flat one: I have omitted the superscript RFK just for simplicity. Indeed on the supergravity side of the correspondence we ought to use only the Ricci-flat metric and there is no ambiguity. 3The hats over the spin connection and the Riemann tensor denote quantities computed without the warp factor. 4The reader should be careful with the indices. Latin indices are always frame indices referring to the vielbein formalism. Furthermore we distinguish the 4 directions of the brane volume by using Latin letters from the beginning of the alphabet while the 6 transversal directions are denoted by Latin letters from the middle and the end of the alphabet. For the coordinate indices we utilize Greek letters and we do exactly the reverse. Early Greek letters α,β,γ,δ,... refer to the 6 transverse directions while Greek letters from the second half of the alphabet µ,ν,ρ,σ,... refer to the D3 brane world volume directions as it is customary in D = 4 field theories. 19Analysis of the field equations in geometrical terms The equations of motion for the scalar fields ϕ and C[0] and for the 3-form field strength FNS [3] and FRR [3] can be better analyzed using the complex notation. Defining: H± = ±2e−ϕ/2FNS [3] +i2eϕ/2 FRR [3] (2.2.10) P = 1 2 dϕ −i1 2 eϕ FRR [1] (2.2.11) eqn.s (2.2.12)-(2.2.13) can be respectively written as: d(⋆P)−ieϕdC[0] ∧⋆P + 1 16 H+ ∧ ⋆H+ = 0 (2.2.12) d ⋆H+ − i 2eϕdC[0] ∧ ⋆H+ = iFRR [5] ∧ H+ −P ∧⋆H− (2.2.13) while the equation for the 5-form becomes: d ⋆FRR [5] = i 1 8 H+ ∧H− (2.2.14) Besides assuming the structure (2.2.2) we also assume that the two scalar fields, namely the dilaton ϕ and the Ramond-Ramond 0-form C[0] are constant and vanishing: ϕ = 0 ; C[0] = 0 (2.2.15) As we shall see, this assumption simplifies considerably the equations of motion, although these two scalar fields can be easily restored. The three-forms The basic ansatz characterizing the solution and providing its interpretation as a D3-brane with three-form fluxes is described below. The ansatz for the complex three-forms of type IIB supergravity is given below and is inspired by what was done in [10, 11] in the case where Y[3] = C×ALEΓ: H+ = Ω(2,1) (2.2.16) where Ω(2,1) is localized on Y[3] and satisfies eqn.s (2.2.6-2.2.7) If we insert the ans¨atze (2.2.15,2.2.16) into the scalar field equation (2.2.12) we obtain: H+ ∧ ⋆10H+ = 0 (2.2.17) This equation is automatically satisfied by our ansatz for a very simple reason that I explain next. The form H+ is by choice a three-form on Y[3] of type (2,1). Let Θ[3] be any three-form that is localized on the transverse six-dimensional 5 manifold Y[3]: Θ[3] = ΘIJK dtI ∧dtJ ∧dtK (2.2.18) When we calculate the Hodge dual of Θ[3] with respect to the 10-dimensional metric (2.2.2) we obtain a 7-form with the following structure: ⋆10 Θ[3] = H−1 V olR(1,3) ∧ eΘ[3] (2.2.19) 5For the sake of the present calculation and the following ones where we have to calculate a Hodge dual, it is more convenient to utilize a set of 6 real coordinates tI (I = 1,..., 6) for the manifold Y[3]. Let ∂I ≡ ∂ ∂tI denote the standard partial derivatives with respect to such coordinates. 20where: V olR(1,3) = 1 4! dxµ ∧dxν ∧dxρ ∧dxσ εµνρσ (2.2.20) is the volume-form of the flat D3-brane and eΘ[3] ≡ ⋆g Θ[3] (2.2.21) is the dual of the three-formΘ[3] with respect to the metricg defined on Y[3]. Let us now specialize the three-form Θ[3] to be of type (2,1): Θ[3] = Q(2,1) (2.2.22) Preservation of supersymmetry requires the complex three-form H+ to obey the condition6 ⋆g Q(2,1) = −iQ(2,1) (2.2.23) Hence: H+ ∧⋆10 H+ = −iQ(2,1) ∧ Q(2,1) ∧ H−1V olR(1,3) = 0 (2.2.24) The self-dual 5-form Next we consider the self-dual 5-form FRR [5] which by definition must satisfy the following Bianchi identity: d FRR [5] = i 1 8 H+ ∧ H− (2.2.25) Our ansatz for FRR [5] is the following: FRR [5] = α (U +⋆10 U) (2.2.26) U = d \u0000 H−1 V olR(1,3) \u0001 (2.2.27) where α is a constant to be determined later. By construction FRR [5] is self-dual and its equation of motion is trivially satisfied. What is not guaranteed is that also the Bianchi identity (2.2.25) is fulfilled. Imposing it, results into a differential equation for the function H (yyy,yyy). Let us see how this works. Starting from the ansatz (2.2.27) we obtain: U = − 1 4! εµνρσ dxµ ∧dxν ∧dxρ ∧dxσ ∧ dH H2 (2.2.28) Uµνρσ I = − 1 4!εµνρσ ∂IH H2 ; all other components vanish (2.2.29) Calculating the components of the dual form ⋆10 U we find that they are non vanishing uniquely in the six transverse directions: ⋆10U = eUI1...I5 dtI1 ∧···∧ dtI5 eUI1...I5 = − pdetg(10) 5! εI1...I5J εµνρσ gJK (10) gµµ ′ 10 gνν ′ (10) gρρ ′ (10) gσσ ′ (10)Uµ′ν′ρ′σ′J = √detg 5! εI1...I5J gJK ∂K H (2.2.30) The essential point in the above calculation is that all powers of the function H exactly cancel so that ⋆10U is 6It also requires H+ to be primitive. 21linear in the H-derivatives 7. Next using the same coordinate basis we obtain: d FRR [5] = α d ⋆U = α 1√detg ∂I \u0010p detggIJ ∂JH \u0011 | {z } 2g H ×V olY[3] = α 2g H(yyy,yyy) × V olY[3] (2.2.31) where: V olY[3] ≡ p detg 1 6!εI1...I6 dtI1 ∧···∧ dtI6 = p detg 1 (3!)2 εαβγ dyα ∧dyβ ∧dyγ ∧εαβγ dyα ∧dyβ ∧dyγ (2.2.32) is the volume form of the transverse six-dimensional space. Once derived with the use of real coordinates, the relation (2.2.31) can be transcribed in terms of complex coordinates and the Laplace-Beltrami operator 2g can be written as in eqn. (2.2.9). Let us now analyze the source terms provided by the three-forms. With our ansatz we obtain: 1 8 H+ ∧ H− = J(yyy,yyy) × V olY[3] J(yyy,yyy) = − 1 72√detg Ωαβ η Ωδθγ εαβγ εηδθ (2.2.33) we conclude that the Bianchi identity (2.2.25) is satisfied by our ansatz if: 2g H = − 1 α J(yyy,yyy) (2.2.34) This is the main differential equation to which the entire construction of the D3-brane solution can be reduced to. We are going to show that the parameter α is determined by Einstein’s equations and fixed to α = 1. The equations for the three–forms Let us consider next the field equation for the complex three-form, namely eqn. (2.2.13). Since the two scalar fields are constant the SU(1,1)/O(2) connection vanishes and we have: d ⋆H+ = iFRR [5] ∧ H+ (2.2.35) Using our ansatz we immediately obtain: d ⋆H+ = = −2iH−2dH ∧ eΩ(2,1),∧ΩR1,3 +2iH−1 d eΩ(2,1) ∧ ΩR1,3 iFRR [5] ∧ H+ = −2αiH−2dH ∧ Ω(2,1) ∧ ΩR1,3 (2.2.36) Hence if α = 1, the field equations for the three-form reduces to: eΩ(2,1) ≡ ⋆gΩ(2,1) = −iΩ(2,1) ; d ⋆g Ω(2,1) = 0 ; dΩ(2,1) = 0 (2.2.37) which are nothing else but eqn.s (2.2.6-2.2.7). In other words the solution of type IIB supergravity with three- form fluxes exists if and only if the transverse space admits closed and imaginary anti-self-dual forms Ω(2,1) as 7Note that we use gIJ to denote the components of the K¨ahler metric (2.2.3) in the real coordinate basis tI. 22we already stated8. In order to show that also the Einstein’s equation is satisfied by our ansatz we have to calculate the (trace subtracted) stress energy tensor of the five and three index field strengths. For this purpose we need the compo- nents of FRR [5] . These are easily dealt with. Relying on the ansatz (2.2.27) and on eqn. (2.2.4) for the vielbein we immediately get: FA1...A5 =    Fiabcd = 1 5! fi εabcd Fj1...i5 = 1 5! εi j1... j5 f i otherwise = 0 (2.2.38) where: fi = −α H−5/4 ∂iH (2.2.39) Then by straightforward algebra we obtain: T a b h FRR [5] i ≡ −75Fa···· Fb···· = −1 8 δa b fp f p = −α2 1 8 δa b H−5/2∂pH ∂ pH T i j h FRR [5] i ≡ −75Fi···· Fj ···· = 1 4 f i f j − 1 8 δi j fp f p = α2 \u00141 4 H−5/4∂iH ∂jH − 1 8 δi j H−5/4∂ pH ∂pH \u0015 (2.2.40) Inserting eqn.s (2.2.40) and (2.2.8) into Einstein’s equations: Ra b = T a b h FRR [5] i Ri j = T i j h FRR [5] i (2.2.41) we see that they are satisfied, provided α = 1 (2.2.42) and the master equation (2.2.34) is satisfied. This concludes our proof that an exact D3-brane solution with aY[3] transverse space does indeed exist. 2.3 Generalities on C3 Γ singularities Recalling what we summarized above we conclude that the singularities relevant to our goals are of the form: X = C3 Γ (2.3.1) where the finite group Γ ⊂ SU(3) has a holomorphic action on C3. For this case, as we mentioned above, there is a series of general results and procedures developed in algebraic geometry that we want to summarize in the perspective of their use in physics. 8By construction a closed anti-self-dual form is also coclosed, namely it is harmonic. 23To begin with let us observe the schematic diagram sketched here below: ~ ⇓ levels ζ of moment map \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000~ @ @ @ @ @ @ @~ r = dimz[FΓ] center of the Lie Algebra r = # of nontrivial Γ irred. represent.s r = # of nontrivial Γ conjugacy classes ⇓ ⇓ age grading, exceptional divisors first Chern classes of tautological bundles n n d d⇔ (2.3.2) The fascination of the mathematical construction lying behind the desingularization process, which has a definite counterpart in the structure of the gauge theories describing D3-branes at the C3/Γ singularity, is the triple interpretation of the same number r which alternatively yields: • The number of nontrivial conjugacy classes of the finite group Γ, • The number of irreducible representations of the finite group Γ, • The center of the Lie algebra z[FΓ] of the compact gauge group FΓ, whose structure, as we will see, is: FΓ = rO i=1 U(ni) (2.3.3) The levels ζI of the moment maps are the main ingredient of the singularity resolution. At level ζI = 0 we have the singular orbifold M0 = C3 Γ , while at ζi ̸= 0 we obtain a smooth manifold Mζ which develops a nontrivial homology and cohomology. In physical parlance the levels ζI are the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters appearing in the lagrangian, while Mζ is the manifold of vacua of the theory, namely of extrema of the potential, as we already emphasized. Quite generally, we find that each of the gauge factors U(ni) is the structural group of a holomorphic vector bundle of rank ni: Vi π− →Mζ (2.3.4) whose first Chern class is a nontrivial (1,1)-cohomology class of the resolved smooth manifold: c1 (Vi) ∈ H1,1 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 (2.3.5) On the other hand the already anticipated very deep theorem originally proved in the nineties by Reid and Ito [39] relates the dimensions of the cohomology groups Hq,q \u0000 Mζ \u0001 to the conjugacy classes of Γ organized according to the grading named age. So named junior classes of age = 1 are associated with H1,1 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 elements, while the so-named senior classes of age = 2 are associated with H2,2 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 elements. The link that pairs irreps with conjugacy classes is provided by the relation, well-known in algebraic ge- ometry, between divisors and line bundles. The conjugacy classes of γ can be put into correspondence with the exceptional divisors created in the resolutionMζ ζ→0 − →C3 Γ and each divisor defines a line bundle whose first Chern class is an element of the H1,1 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 cohomology group. These line bundles labeled by conjugacy classes have to be compared with the line bundles created by the K¨ahler quotient procedure that are instead associated with the irreps, as we have sketched above. In this way we 24build the bridge between conjugacy classes and irreps. Finally there is the question whether the divisor is compact or not. In the first case, by Poincar ´e duality, we obtain nontrivial H2,2 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 elements. In the second case we have no new cohomology classes. The age grading precisely informs us about the compact or noncompact nature of the divisors. Each senior class corresponds to a cohomology class of degree 4, thus signaling the existence of a non-trivial closed (2,2) form, and via Poincar´e duality, it also corresponds to a compact component of the exceptional divisor. The physics–friendly illustration of this general beautiful scheme, together with the explicit construction of a few concrete examples is among the priorities of the present lectures. Let me begin with the concept of age grading. 2.3.1 The concept of age grading for conjugacy classes of the discrete group Γ According to the above quoted theorem that we shall explain below, the age grading of Γ conjugacy classes allows to predict the Dolbeault cohomology of the resolved algebraic variety. It goes as follows. Suppose that Γ (a finite group) acts in a linear way on Cn. Consider an element γ ∈ Γ whose action is the following: γ. ⃗z =   ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   | {z } Q(γ) ·   z1 ... zn   (2.3.6) Since in a finite group all elements have a finite order, there exists r ∈ N, such that γr = 1. We define the age of an element in the following way. Let us diagonalize D(γ), namely compute its eigenvalues. They will be as follows: (λ1,..., λn) =exp \u00142π i r ai \u0015 ; r > ai ∈ N i = 1,..., n (2.3.7) We define: age(γ) = 1 r n ∑ i=1 ai (2.3.8) Clearly the age is a property of the conjugacy class of the element, relative to the considered three-dimensional complex representation. 2.3.2 The fundamental theorem In [39] Y . Ito and M. Reid proved the following fundamental theorem: Theorem 2.3.1 Let Y Γ [3] → C3/Γ be a crepant 9 resolution of a Gorenstein 10 singularity. Then we have the following relation between the de-Rham cohomology groups of the resolved smooth variety Y Γ [3] and the ages of Γ conjugacy classes: dimH2k \u0010 Y Γ [3] \u0011 = # of age k conjugacy classes of Γ On the other hand it happens that all odd cohomology groups are trivial: dimH2k+1 \u0010 Y Γ [3] \u0011 = 0 (2.3.9) 9A resolution of singularities X →Y Γ [3] is crepant when the canonical bundle of X is the pullback of the canonical bundle of Y Γ [3]. 10A variety is Gorenstein when the canonical divisor is a Cartier divisor, i.e., a divisor corresponding to a line bundle. 25This is true also in the case ofC2/Γ singularities, yet in n = 2,3 the consequences of the same fact are drastically different. In all complex dimensions n the deformations of the K ¨ahler class are in one-to-one correspondence with the harmonic forms ω(1,1), while those of the complex structure are in correspondence with the harmonic forms ω(n−1,1). In n = 2 the harmonic ω(1,1) forms play the double role of K ¨ahler class deformations and complex structure deformations. This is the reason why we can do a hyperK ¨ahler quotient and we have both moduli parameters in the K¨ahler potential and in the polynomials cutting out the smooth variety. Instead inn = 3 eqn. (2.3.9) implies that the polynomials constraints cutting the singular locus have no deformation parameters. The parameters of the resolution occur only at the level of the K¨ahler quotient and are the levels of the K¨ahlerian moment maps. Given an algebraic representation of the varietyY Γ [3] as the vanishing locus of certain polynomialsW(x) =0, the algebraic 2k-cycles are the 2k-cycles that can be holomorphically embedded in Y Γ [3]. The following statement in n = 3 is elementary: Statement 2.3.1 The Poincar´e dual of any algebraic 2k-cycle is of type (k,k). Its converse is known as the Hodge conjecture, stating that any cycle of type (k,k) is a linear combination of algebraic cycles. This will hold true for the varieties we shall be considering. Thus we conclude that the so named junior conjugacy classes (age=1) are in a one-to-one correspondence with ω(1,1)-forms that span H1,1, while conjugacy classes of age 2 are in one-to-one correspondence with ω(2,2)- forms that span H2,2. 2.4 Comparison with ALE manifolds and comments Let us compare the above predictions for the case B) of C3/Γ singularities with the well known case A) of C2/Γ where Γ is a Kleinian subgroup of SU (2) and the resolution of the singularity leads to an ALE manifold [4, 26, 1, 2, 10, 11]. As we already stressed above, this latter can be explicitly constructed by means of a hyperK¨ahler quotient, according to Kronheimer’s construction. In table 2.1 I summarize some well known facts about Y Γ [2] → X = C2/Γ which are the following. Here χ denotes Hirzebruch’s signature characteristic of the resolved manifold. 1. As an affine variety the singular orbifold X is described by a single polynomial equation WΓ(u,w,z) =0 in C3. This equation is simply given by a relation existing among the invariants of Γ as we anticipated in the previous section. Note that this is the case also for X = C3 PSL(2,7) , as Markushevich has shown. He has found one polynomial constraint WPSL(2,7)(u1,u2,u3,u4) =0 of degree 10 in C4 which describes X. We were able to find a similar result for the subgroup G 21 ⊂ PSL(2,7) and obviously also for the cases C3/Z3 and C3/Z7. In the G 21 case the equation is of order 16. We will present these results in a future publication11. 2. The resolved locus Y Γ [2] in the case of ALE manifolds is described by a deformed equation: WALE Γ (u,w,z; t) = WΓ(u,w,z) + r ∑ i=1 ti P(i)(u,w,z) r ≡ dimRΓ (2.4.1) where 11As I mentioned above there is a series of partial and not fully accomplished results that were discovered in the framework of the my and Ugo Bruzzo’s collaboration with Massimo Bianchi that remained on hold for a couple of years in the pandemic times and that now we plan to work out in collaboration also with Mario Trigiante within the larger scope provided by the other results obtained in [24, 25]. I refer the reader to chapter 6 for a discussion of the open questions. 26Table 2.1: Finite SU(2) subgroups versus ALE manifold properties Γ.

According to the general view put forward in the previous section, for ALE manifolds we have: dimH1,1 = r ≡ # nontrivial conjugacy classes of Γ (2.4.3) 27We also have: dimRΓ = r (2.4.4) as one sees from table 2.1. From the point of view of complex geometry this is the consequence of a special coincidence, already stressed in the previous section, which applies only to the case of complex dimension 2. As one knows, for Calabi-Yau n-folds complex structure deformations are associated with ωn−1,1 ∈ Hn−1,1 harmonic forms, while K ¨ahler structure deformations, for all n, are associated with ω1,1 ∈ H1,1 harmonic forms. Hence when n = 2, the (1,1)-forms play a double role as complex structure deformations and as K ¨ahler structure deformations. For instance, this is well known in the case of K3. Hence in the n = 2 case the number of nontrivial conjugacy classes of the group Γ coincides both with the number of K¨ahler moduli and with number of complex structure moduli of the resolved variety. 4. In the case of Y Γ [3] → X = C3 Γ the number of (1,1)-forms and hence of K ¨ahler moduli is still related with r = # junior conjugacy classes of Γ but there are no complex structure deformations. 2.4.1 The McKay correspondence for C2/Γ The table of characters χ(µ) i of any finite group γ allows to reconstruct the decomposition coefficients of any representation along the irreducible representations: D = rM µ=1 aµ Dµ aµ = 1 g r ∑ i=1 gi χ(D) i χ(µ)⋆ i (2.4.5) where χ(D) is the character of D. For the finite subgroups Γ ⊂ SU(2) a particularly important case is the decom- position of the tensor product of an irreducible representationDµ with the defining 2-dimensional representation Q. It is indeed at the level of this decomposition that the relation between these groups and the simply laced Dynkin diagrams becomes explicit and is named the McKay correspondence [3]. This decomposition plays a crucial role in the explicit construction of ALE manifolds according to Kronheimer. Setting Q ⊗ Dµ = rM ν=0 Aµν Dν (2.4.6) where D0 denotes the identity representation, one finds that the matrix cµν = 2δµν −Aµν is the extended Cartan matrix relative to the extended Dynkin diagram corresponding to the given group. We remind the reader that the extended Dynkin diagram of any simply laced Lie algebra is obtained by adding to the dots representing the simple roots {α1 ......αr } an additional dot (marked black in figs. 2.1, 2.2) representing the negative of the highest root α0 = ∑r i=1 ni αi (ni are the Coxeter numbers). Thus we see a correspondence between the nontrivial conjugacy classes Ci (or equivalently the nontrivial irreps) of the group Γ(G) and the simple roots of G. In this correspondence the extended Cartan matrix provides the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients (2.4.6), while the Coxeter numbers ni express the dimensions of the irreducible representations. All these informations are summarized in Figs. 2.1, 2.2 where the numbers ni are attached to each of the dots: the number 1 is attached to the extra dot since it stands for the identity representation. 28e u e e e · ·· · ··· \u0014 \u0014\u0014 T TT 1 1 1 1 1 Ak Dk+2 e e 2 2 ··· e 2 u1 e1 e e 1 1 HH \b\b \b\b HH Figure 2.1: Extended Dynkin diagrams of the infinite series E8 = I e e e e e e e u 2 4 6 5 4 3 2 1 e3 E7 = O e e e e e e u 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 e2 E6 = T e e e e e 1 2 3 2 1 e2 1 u Figure 2.2: Exceptional extended Dynkin diagrams 2.4.2 Kronheimer’s construction Given any finite subgroup Γ ⊂ SU(2), we consider a space P whose elements are two-vectors of |Γ| × |Γ| complex matrices: (A,B) ∈ P. The action of an element γ ∈ Γ on the points of P is the following:   A B ! γ − →   uγ ivγ ivγ uγ !   R(γ)AR(γ−1) R(γ)BR(γ−1) ! (2.4.7) where the two-dimensional matrix on the right hand side is the realization ofγ inside the defining two-dimensional representation Q ⊂ SU(2), while R(γ) is the regular, |Γ|-dimensional representation. The basis vectors in R named eγ are in one-to-one correspondence with the group elements γ ∈ Γ and transform as follows: R(γ)eδ = eγ·δ ∀γ , δ ∈ Γ (2.4.8) Intrinsically, the space P is named as: P ≃ Hom(R,Q⊗R) (2.4.9) Next we introduce the space S, which by definition is the subspace made of Γ-invariant elements in P: S ≡ {p ∈ P/∀γ ∈ Γ,γ · p = p} (2.4.10) Explicitly the invariance condition reads as follows:   uγ ivγ ivγ uγ !   A B ! =   R(γ−1)AR(γ) R(γ−1)BR(γ) ! (2.4.11) The decomposition (2.4.6) is very useful in order to determine the Γ-invariant vector space (2.4.10). A two-vector of matrices can be thought of also as a matrix of two-vectors: that is, P = Q⊗Hom(R,R) = Hom(R,Q⊗R). Decomposing the regular representation, R = Lr ν=0 nµDµ into irreps, using eqn. (2.4.6) and 29Schur’s lemma, we obtain: S = M µ,ν Aµ,νHom(Cnµ ,Cnν ) . (2.4.12) The dimensions of the irreps, nµ are dispayed in figs. 2.1,2.2. From eqn. (2.4.12) the real dimension of S follows immediately: dim S = ∑µ,ν 2Aµν nµnν implies, recalling that A = 2 ×1 −c [see eqn. (2.4.6)] and that for the extended Cartan matrix cn = 0: dimC S = 2∑ µ n2 µ = 2|Γ| . (2.4.13) Intrinsically, one writes the space S as: S ≃ HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) (2.4.14) So we can summarize the discussion by saying that: dimC [HomΓ (R,Q⊗R)] =2|Γ| (2.4.15) The quaternionic structure of the flat manifolds P and S can be seen by simply writing their elements as follows: p =   A iB † iB A † ! ∈ Hom(R,Q⊗R) A,B ∈ End(R) . Then the hyperK¨ahler forms and the hyperK¨ahler metric are defined by the following formulae: Θ = Tr(dp† ∧dp) =   iK iΩΩΩ iΩΩΩ −iK ! ds2 ×1 = Tr(dp† ⊗dp) (2.4.16) In the above equations the trace is taken over the matrices belonging to End (R) in each entry of the quaternion. From eqn. (2.4.16) we extract the explicit expressions for the K¨ahler 2-form K and the holomorphic 2-form ΩΩΩ of the flat hyperK¨ahler manifold Hom(R,Q⊗R). We have: K = −i \u0002 Tr \u0000 dA† ∧dA \u0001 +Tr \u0000 dB† ∧dB \u0001\u0003 ≡ igαβ dqα ∧dqβ ds2 = gαβ dqα ⊗dqβ ΩΩΩ = 2Tr(dA ∧dB) ≡ Ωαβ dqα ∧dqβ (2.4.17) Starting from the above written formulae, by means of an elementary calculation one verifies that both the metric and the hyperK¨ahler forms are invariant with respect to the action of the discrete groupΓ defined in eqn. (2.4.7). Hence one can consistently reduce the space Hom (R,Q⊗R) to the invariant space Hom Γ (R,Q⊗R) defined in eqn. (2.4.10). The hyperK ¨ahler 2-forms and the metric of the flat space S, whose real dimension is 4 |Γ|, are given by eqs.(2.4.17) where the matrices A,B satisfy the invariance condition eqn. (2.4.11). I mentioned in the introductory chapter 1 that in the early 1990.s the Kronheimer construction was utilized by myself in collaboration with Anselmi, Bill `o, Girardello and Zaffaroni to discuss N = 2 conformal field theories in two- dimensions. Furthermore as I already said, in the same decade ALE-manifolds were the object of several other applications to theoretical physics in the context of gravitational and gauge instantons with a particularly active role played by the group of Rome Tor Vergata [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. 30Solution of the invariance constraint in the case of the cyclic groups Ak The space S can be easily described when Γ is the cyclic group Ak = Zk+1, whose multiplication table can be read off. We can immediately read it off from the matrices of the regular representation. Obviously, it is sufficient to consider the representative of the first element e1, as R(ej) = (R(e1))j. One has: R(e1) =   0 0 ··· 0 1 1 0 ··· 0 0 0 1 ··· 0 0 ... ... ... ... ... 0 0 ··· 1 0   (2.4.18) Actually, the invariance condition eqn. (2.4.11) is best solved by changing basis so as to diagonalize the regular representation, realizing explicitly its decomposition in terms of the k unidimensional irreps. Let ν = e 2πi k+1 , be a (k +1)th root of unity so that νk+1 = 1. The looked for change of basis is performed by means of the matrix: Si j = 1√ k +1 νi j ; i, j = 0,1,2,..., k \u0000 S−1\u0001 i j = \u0000 S†\u0001 i j = 1√ k +1 νk+1−i j (2.4.19) In the new basis we find: bR(e0) ≡ S−1 R(e0)S =   1 0 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 ... ... ... ... ... 0 0 ... 1 0 0 0 ... 0 1   bR(e1) ≡ S−1 R(e1)S =   1 0 ... 0 0 0 ν 0... 0 0 ... ... ... ... ... 0 0 ... νk−1 0 0 0 ... 0 νk   (2.4.20) Eq. (2.4.20) displays on the diagonal the representatives of ej in the one-dimensional irreps. In the above basis, the explicit solution of eqn. (2.4.11) is given by A =   0 u0 0 ··· 0 0 0 u1 ··· 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... uk−1 uk 0 0 ··· 0   ; B =   0 0 ··· ··· vk v0 0 ··· ··· 0 0 v1 ··· ··· 0 ... ... ... ... 0 0 ··· vk−1 0   (2.4.21) 31We see that these matrices are parameterized in terms of 2k +2 complex, i.e. 4(k +1) =|Ak| real parameters. In the Dk+2 case, where the regular representation is 4k-dimensional, choosing appropriately a basis, one can solve analogously eqn. (2.4.11); the explicit expressions are too large, so we do not write them. The essential point is that the matrices A and B no longer correspond to two distinct set of parameters, the group being nonabelian. 2.4.3 The gauge group for the quotient and its moment maps The next step in the Kronheimer construction of the ALE manifolds is the determination of the group F of tri- holomorphic isometries with respect to which we will perform the quotient. We borrow from physics the nomen- clature gauge group since in a N = 3,4 rigid three-dimensional gauge theory where the space HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) is the flat manifold of hypermultiplet scalars, the triholomorphic moment maps ofF emerge as scalar dependent nonderivative terms in the hyperino supersymmetry transformation rules generated by the gauging of the group F. Consider the action of SU(|Γ|) on Hom(R,Q⊗R) given, using the quaternionic notation for the elements of Hom(R,Q⊗R), by ∀g ∈ SU(|Γ|) , g :   A iB † iB A † ! 7− →   gAg−1 igB † g−1 igBg −1 gA† g−1 ! (2.4.22) It is easy to see that this action is a triholomorphic isometry of Hom (R,Q⊗R). Indeed both the hyperK ¨ahler forms Θ and the metric ds2 are invariant. Let F ⊂ SU(|Γ|) be the subgroup of the above group which commutes with the action of Γ on the space Hom(R,Q⊗R), action which was defined in eqn. (2.4.7). Then the action ofF descends to HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) ⊂ Hom(R,Q⊗R) to give a triholomorphic isometry: indeed the metric and the hyperK ¨ahler forms on the space HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) are just the restriction of those on Hom (R,Q⊗R). Therefore one can take the hyperK ¨ahler quotient of HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) with respect to F. Let {fA} be a basis of generators forF, the Lie algebra ofF. Under the infinitesimal action of f = 1+λA fA ∈ F, the variation of p ∈ HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) is δ p = λAδA p, with δA p =   [ fA,A] i[ fA,B†] i[ fA,B] [ fA,A†] ! The components of the momentum map are then given by µA = Tr(q† δA p) ≡ Tr   fA µ3(p) fA µ−(p) fA µ+(p) fA µ3(p) ! so that the real and holomorphic maps µ3 : HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) → F∗ and µ+ : HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) → C×F∗ can be represented as matrix-valued maps: µ3(p) = −i \u0000 [A,A†]+[ B,B†] \u0001 µ+(p) = ([ A,B]) . (2.4.23) In this way we get: µA =   P3 A P− A P+ A −P3 A ! (2.4.24) 32where: P3 A = −i \u0002 Tr \u0000\u0002 A, A†\u0003 fA \u0001 +Tr \u0000\u0002 B† , B \u0003 fA \u0001\u0003 P+ A = Tr([A, B] fA) (2.4.25) Let Z⋆ be the dual of the center of F. In correspondence with a level ζ = {ζ3,ζ+} ∈R3 ⊗Z⋆ we can form the hyperK¨ahler quotient: Mζ ≡ µ−1(ζ)/ /HK F (2.4.26) Varying ζ and Γ all ALE manifolds can be obtained as Mζ . First of all, it is not difficult to check that Mζ is four-dimensional. Let us see how this happens. There is a nice characterization of the group F in terms of the extended Dynkin diagram associated with Γ. We have F = r+1O µ=1 U(nµ) \\ SU(|Γ|) (2.4.27) where the sum is extended to all the irreducible representations of the group Γ and nµ are their dimensions. One should also take into account that the determinant of all the elements must be one, sinceF ⊂ SU(|Γ|). Pictorially the group F has a U(nµ) factor for each dot of the diagram, nµ being associated with the dots as in figs. 2.1,2.2. F acts on the variouscomponents of HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) that are in correspondence with the edges of the diagram, see eqn. (2.4.12), as dictated by the diagram structure. From eqn. (2.4.27) it is immediate to derive: dimF = ∑ µ n2 µ −1 = |Γ|− 1 (2.4.28) It follows that dimR Mζ = dimR HomΓ (R,Q⊗R)−4dimR F = 4|Γ|− (4|Γ|− 1) =4 (2.4.29) Analyzing the construction we see that there are two steps. In the first step, by setting the holomorphic part of the moment map to its level ζ, we define an algebraic locus in Hom Γ(Q⊗R,R). Next the K ¨ahler quotient further reduces such a locus to the necessary complex dimension 2. The two steps are united in one because of the triholomorphic character of the isometries. As we already stressed in the previous section, in complex dimension 3 the isometries are not triholomorphic rather just holomorphic; hence the holomorphic part of the moment map does not exist and the two steps have to be separated. There must be another principle that leads to impose those constraints that cut out the algebraic locus V|Γ|+2 of which we perform the K ¨ahler quotient in the next step (see eqn. (2.1.36)). The main question is to spell out such principles. As anticipated, equation p ∧p = 0 is the one that does the job. We are not able to reduce the 3|Γ|2 quadrics on 3|Γ| variables to an ideal with 2|Γ|− 2 generators, yet we know that such reduction must exist. Indeed, by means of another argument that utilizes Lie group orbits we can show that there is a variety of complex dimension 3, named D0 Γ which is in the kernel of the equation p ∧p = 0. The triholomorphic moment maps in the Ak case of Kronheimer construction The structure of F and the momentum map for its action are very simply worked out in theAk case. An element f ∈ F must commute with the action of Ak on P, eqn. (2.4.7), where the two-dimensional representation in the l.h.s. is given by: Γ(Ak) γℓ = Qℓ ≡   e2πiℓ/(k+1) 0 0 e−2πiℓ/(k+1) ! ; {ℓ = 1,....., k +1} 33Then f must have the form f = diag(eiϕ0 ,eiϕ1 ,..., eiϕk ) ; k ∑ i=0 ϕi = 0 . (2.4.30) Thus F is just the algebra of diagonal traceless k + 1-dimensional matrices, which is k-dimensional. Choose a basis of generators for F, for instance: f1 = diag(1,−1,0,..., 0) f2 = diag(1,0,−1,0,..., 0) ... = ... fk = diag(1,0,0,..., 0,−1) (2.4.31) From eqn. (2.4.25) we immediately obtain the components of the momentum map: P3 A = |u0|2 −|uk|2 −|v0|2 +|vk|2 + \u0000 |uA−1|2 −|uA|2 −|vA−1|2 +|vA|2\u0001 P+ A = u0v0 −ukvk + \u0000 uA−1vA−1 − uA vA \u0001 , (A = 1,..., k) (2.4.32) 2.4.4 Level sets and Weyl chambers If F acts freely on µ−1(ζ) then Mζ is a smooth manifold. This happens or does not happen depending on the value of ζ. A simple characterization of Z can be given in terms of the simple Lie algebra G associated with Γ. There exists an isomorphism between Z and the Cartan subalgebra HCSA ⊂ G. Thus we have dim Z = dim HCSA = rankG = #of nontrivial conj . classes in Γ (2.4.33) The space Mζ turns out to be singular when, under the above identification Z ∼ HCSA, any of the level compo- nents ζi ∈ R3 ⊗Z lies on a wall of a Weyl chamber. In particular, as the point ζi = 0, (i = 1,..., r) is identified with the origin of the root space, which lies of course on all the walls of the Weyl chambers, the space M0 is singular. Not too surprisingly we will see in a moment that M0 corresponds to the orbifold limit C2/Γ of a family of ALE manifolds with boundary at infinity S3/Γ. To verify this statement in general let us choose the natural basis for the regular representation R, in which the basis vectors eδ transform as in eqn. (2.4.8). Define the space L ⊂ S as follows: L = (  C D ! ∈ S /C,D are diagonal in the basis {eδ } ) (2.4.34) For every element γ ∈ Γ there is a pair of numbers (cγ,dγ) given by the corresponding entries of C,D : C ·eγ = cγeγ, D ·eγ = dγeγ. Applying the invariance condition eqn. (2.4.11), which is valid since L ⊂ S, we obtain:   cγ·δ dγ·δ ! =   uγ ivγ ivγ uγ !  cδ dδ ! (2.4.35) We can identifyL with C2 associating for instance (C,D) ∈ L 7− →(c0,d0) ∈ C2. Indeed all the other pairs(cγ,dγ) are determined in terms of eqn. (2.4.35) once (c0,d0) are given. By eqn. (2.4.35) the action of Γ on L induces exactly the action of Γ on C2 provided by its two-dimensional defining representation inside SU (2). It is quite easy to show the following fundamental fact: each orbit of F in µ−1(0) meets L in one orbit of Γ. Because of the above identification between L and C2, this leads to conclude that µ−1(0)/F is isometric to C2/Γ. Instead 34of reviewing the formal proofs of these statements as devised by Kronheimer, we will verify them explicitly in the case of the cyclic groups, giving a description which sheds some light on the deformed situation; that is we show in which way a nonzero level ζ+ for the holomorphic momentum map puts µ−1(ζ) in correspondence with the affine hypersurface in C3 cut out by the polynomial constraint (2.4.1) which is a deformation of that describing the C2/Γ orbifold, obtained for ζ+ = 0. Retrieving the polynomial constraint from the hyperK¨ahler quotient in the Γ=Ak case. We can directly realize C2/Γ as an affine algebraic surface in C3 by expressing the coordinates x, y and z of C3 in terms of the matrices (C,D) ∈ L. The explicit parametrization of the matrices in S in the Ak case, which was given in eqn. (2.4.21) in the basis in which the regular representationR is diagonal, can be conveniently rewritten in the natural basis \b eγ \t via the matrix S−1 defined in eqn. (2.4.19). The subset L of diagonal matrices (C,D) is given by: C = c0 diag(1,ν,ν2,..., νk), D = d0 diag(1,νk,νk−1,..., ν), (2.4.36) This is nothing but the fact that L ∼ C2. The set of pairs   νmc0 νk−md0 ! , m = 0,1,..., k is an orbit of Γ in C2 and determines the corresponding orbit of Γ in L. To describe C2/Ak one needs to identify a suitable set of invariants (u,w,z) ∈ C3 such that 0 = WΓ(u,w,z) ≡ u2 +w2 − zk+1 (2.4.37) To this effect we define: u = 1 2 (x +y) ; w = −i1 2 (x −y) ⇒ xy = u2 +w2 (2.4.38) and we make the following ansatz: x = det C ; y = det D, ; z = 1 k +1TrCD. (2.4.39) This guess is immediately confirmed by the study of the deformed surface. We know that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the orbits of F in µ−1(0) and those of Γ in L. Let us realize this correspondence explicitly. Choose the basis whereR is diagonal. Then (A,B) ∈ S have the form of eqn. (2.4.21). The relationxy = zk+1 holds also true when, in eqn. (2.4.39), the pair (C,D) ∈ L is replaced by an element (A,B) ∈ µ−1(0). To see this, let us describe the elements (A,B) ∈ µ−1(0). We have to equate the right hand sides of eqn. (2.4.23) to zero. We note that: [A,B] =0 ⇒ vi = u0v0 ui ∀i (2.4.40) Secondly, [A,A†]+[ B,B†] =0 ⇒ | ui| = |uj|and|vi| = |vj| ∀i, j (2.4.41) From the previous two equations we conclude that: uj = |u0|eiφj ; vj = |v0|eiψj (2.4.42) Finally: [A,B] =0 ⇒ ψj = Φ−φj ∀j (2.4.43) where Φ is an arbitrary overall phase. 35In this way, we have characterized µ−1(0) and we immediately check that the pair (A,B) ∈ µ−1(0) satisfies xy = zk+1 if x = det A, y = det B and z = 1/(k +1)TrAB as we have proposed in eqn. (2.4.39). After this explicit solution of the momentum map constraint has been implemented we are left with k + 4 parameters, namely the k +1 phases φj, j = 0,1,... k, plus the absolute values |u0| and |v0| and the overall phase Φ. So we have: dim µ−1(0) =dimS −3dim F = 4|Γ|− 3(|Γ|− 1) =|Γ|+3 (2.4.44) where |Γ| = k +1. Now we perform the quotient of µ−1(0) with respect to F. Given a set of phases fi such that ∑k i=0 fi = 0mod2 π and given f = diag(ei f0 ,ei f1 ,..., ei fk ) ∈ F, the orbit of F in µ−1(0) passing through   A B ! has the form   f A f−1 f B f−1 ! . Choosing f j = f0 + jψ + ∑j−1 n=0 φn, j = 1,..., k, with ψ = −1 k ∑k n=0 φn, and f0 determined by the condition ∑k i=0 fi = 0mod2 π, one obtains f A f−1 = a0   0 1 0 ... 0 0 0 1 ... 0 ... ... 0 0 ... 0 1 1 0 0 ... 0   , f B f−1 = b0   0 0 ... 0 1 1 0 0 ... 0 0 1 0 ... 0 ... ... 0 ... 0 1 0   (2.4.45) where a0 = |u0|eiψ and b0 = |v0|ei(Φ−ψ). Since the phases φj are determined modulo 2 π, it follows that ψ is determined modulo 2π k+1 . Thus we can say (a0,b0) ∈ C2/Γ. This is the one-to-one correspondence between µ−1(0)/F and C2/Γ. Next we derive the deformed relation between the invariants x,y,z. It fixes the correspondence between the resolution of the singularity performed in the momentum map approach and the resolution performed on the hypersurface xy = zk+1 in C3. To this purpose, we focus on the holomorphic part of the momentum map, i.e. on the equation: [A,B] =Λ0 = diag(λ0,λ1,λ2,..., λk) ∈ Z⊗C (2.4.46) λ0 = − k ∑ i=1 λi (2.4.47) Let us recall the expression (2.4.21) for the matrices A and B. Naming ai = uivi, eqn. (2.4.46) implies: ai = a0 +λi ; i = 1,..., k (2.4.48) Let Λ = diag(λ1,λ2,..., λk). We have xy = detA detB = a0 Πk i=1(a0 +λi) =ak+1 0 det \u0012 1 + 1 a0 Λ \u0013 = k ∑ i=0 ak+1−i 0 Si(Λ) (2.4.49) The Si(Λ) are the symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues ofΛ. They are defined by the relation det(1+tΛ) = 36∑k i=0 tiSi(Λ) and are given by: Si(Λ) = ∑ j1< j2<···< ji λj1 λj2 ··· λji (2.4.50) In particular, S0 = 1 and S1 = ∑k i=1 λi. Define Sk+1(Λ) =0, so that we can rewrite: xy = k+1 ∑ i=0 ak+1−i 0 Si(Λ) (2.4.51) and note that z = 1 k +1TrAB = a0 + 1 k +1S1(Λ). (2.4.52) Then the desired deformed relation between x, y and z is obtained by substituting a0 = z − 1 k S1 in (2.4.49), thus obtaining xy = k+1 ∑ m=0 k+1−m ∑ n=0   k +1 −m n ! zn \u0012 − 1 k +1S1 \u0013k+1−m−n Sm zn = k+1 ∑ n=0 tn+1 zn =⇒ tn+1 = k+1−n ∑ m=0   k +1 −m n !\u0012 − 1 k +1S1 \u0013k+1−m−n (2.4.53) Note in particular that tk+2 = 1 and tk+1 = 0, i.e. xy = zk+1 + k ∑ n=0 tn+1zn (2.4.54) which means that the deformation proportional to zk is absent. This establishes a clear correspondence between the momentum map construction and the polynomial ringC[x,y,z] ∂W where W(x,y,z) =xy−zk+1. Moreover, note that we have only used one of the momentum map equations, namely [A,B] =Λ0. The equation [A,A†]+[ B,B†] =Σ has been completely ignored. This means that the deformation of the complex structure is described by the parameters Λ, while the parameters Σ describe the deformation of the K¨ahler structure. The relation (2.4.53) can also be written in a simple factorized form, namely xy = Πk i=0(z −µi), (2.4.55) where µi = 1 k (λ1 +λ2 +··· +λi−1 −2λi +λi+1 +··· +λk), i = 1,..., k −1 µ0 = − k ∑ i=1 µi = 1 k S1. (2.4.56) 2.5 Generalization of the correspondence: McKay quivers for C3/Γ singulari- ties One can generalize the extended Dynkin diagrams obtained in the above way by constructing McKay quivers, according to the following definition: Definition 2.5.1 Let us consider the quotient Cn/Γ, where Γ is a finite group that acts on Cn by means of the 37complex representation Q of dimension n and let Di, (i = 1,..., r + 1) be the set of irreducible representations of Γ having denoted by r +1 the number of conjugacy classes of Γ. Let the matrix Ai j be defined by: Q⊗Di = r+1M j=1 Ai j Dj (2.5.1) To such a matrix we associate a quiver diagram in the following way. Every irreducible representation is denoted by a circle labeled with a number equal to the dimension of the corresponding irrep. Next we write an oriented line going from circle i to circle j if Dj appears in the decomposition of Q⊗Di, namely if the matrix element Ai j does not vanish. The analogue of the extended Cartan matrix discussed in the case of C2/Γ is defined below: ci j = nδi j − Ai j (2.5.2) and it has the same property, namely, it admits the vector of irrep dimensions n ≡ {1,n1,..., nr} (2.5.3) as a null vector: c.n = 0 (2.5.4) Typically the McKay quivers encode the information determining the interaction structure of the dual gauge theory on the brane world volume. Indeed the bridge between Mathematics and Physics is located precisely at this point. In the case of a single D3-brane, the n|Γ| complex coordinates (n=2, or 3) of the flat K¨ahler manifold HomΓ(R,Q ⊗R) are the scalar fields of the Wess-Zumino multiplets, the unitary group F commuting with the action of Γ is the gauge group, the moment maps ofF enter the definition of the potential, according to standard supersymmetry formulae and the holomorphic constraints defining the V|Γ|+2 variety have to be related with the superpotential W of the N = 1 theories in d=4 ( i.e. the n=3 case where the singular space is C3/Γ). In the case of N = 2 theories, (i.e. the n=2 case where the singular space is C×C2/Γ), the holomorphic constraints Pi(y) are identified with the holomorphic part of the tri-holomorphic moment map. When one goes to the case of multiple D3-branes the gauge group is enlarged by color indices. This is another story. The first step is to understand the case of one D3-brane and here the map between Physics and Mathematics is one-to-one. 2.5.1 Representations of the quivers and K ¨ahler quotients Let us now follow the same steps of the Kronheimer construction and derive the representations of the C3/Γ quivers. The key point is the construction of the analogues of the spaces PΓ in eqn. (2.4.9) and of its invariant subspace SΓ in eqn. (2.4.10). To this effect we introduce three matrices|Γ|×| Γ| named A,B,C and set: p ∈ PΓ ≡ Hom(R,Q⊗R) ⇒ p =   A B C   (2.5.5) The action of the discrete group Γ on the space PΓ is defined in full analogy with the Kronheimer case: ∀γ ∈ Γ : γ · p ≡ Q(γ)   R(γ)AR(γ−1) R(γ)BR(γ−1) R(γ)C R(γ−1)   (2.5.6) 38where Q(γ) denotes the three-dimensional complex representation of the group element γ, while R(γ) denotes its |Γ|×| Γ|-matrix image in the regular representation. In complete analogy with eqn. (2.4.10) the subspace SΓ is obtained by setting: SΓ ≡ HomΓ (R,Q ⊗R) ={p ∈ PΓ/∀γ ∈ Γ,γ · p = p} (2.5.7) Just as in the previous case a three-vector of matrices can be thought as a matrix of three-vectors: that is, Pγ = Q⊗Hom(R,R) =Hom(R,Q⊗R). Decomposing the regular representation, R = Lr i=0 niDi into irreps, using eqn. (2.5.1) and Schur’s lemma, we obtain: SΓ = M i, j Ai, jHom(Cni ,Cnj ) (2.5.8) The properties (2.5.2,2.5.3,2.5.4) of the matrix Ai j associated with the quiver diagram guarantee, in perfect analogy with eqn. (2.4.13) dimC SΓ ≃ HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) =3∑ i n2 i = 3|Γ| . (2.5.9) 2.5.2 The quiver Lie group, its maximal compact subgroup and the K ¨ahler quotient We address now the most important point, namely the reduction of the 3 |Γ|-dimensional complex manifold HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) to a |Γ| + 2-dimensional subvariety of which we will perform the K ¨ahler quotient in order to obtain the final 3-dimensional (de-singularized) smooth manifold that provides the crepant resolution. The inspiration about how this can be done is provided by comparison with the C2/Γ case, mutatis mutandis. The key formulae to recall are the following ones: eqn. (2.4.23), (2.4.27) and (2.4.34). From eqn. (2.4.23) we see that the analytic part of the triholomorphic moment map is provided by the projec- tion onto the gauge group generators of the commutator [A, B]. When the level parameters are all zero (namely when the locus equation is not perturbed by the elements of the chiral ring) the outcome of the moment map equation is simply the condition [A, B] =0. In the case of C3/Γ we already know that there are no deformations of the complex structure and that the analogue of the holomorphic moment map constraint has to be a rigid pa- rameterless condition. Namely the ideal that cuts out the V|Γ|+2 variety should be generated by a list of quadric polynomials Pi(y) fixed once and for all in a parameterless way. It is reasonable to guess that these equations should be a generalization of the condition [A, B] =0. In the C3/Γ case we have three matrices A,B,C and the obvious generalization is given below: p ∧p = 0 (2.5.10) where: p =   A B C   ∈ HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) p1 = A ; p2 = B ; p3 = C (2.5.11) This is a short-hand for the following explicit equations 0 = εi jkpi ·pj ⇕ 0 = [ A,B] = [B,C] = [C,A] (2.5.12) Eq. (2.5.10) is the very same equation numbered (1.18) in Craw’s doctoral thesis [31]. We will see in a moment 39that it is indeed the correct equation reducing HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) to a |Γ|+2-dimensional subvariety. The way to understand it goes once again through a detailed comparison with the Kronheimer case. One has to discuss the construction of the gauge group and to recall the identification of the singular orb- ifold C2/Γ with the subspace named L defined by eqn. (2.4.34). Both constructions have a completely parallel analogue in the C3/Γ case and these provide the key to understand why (2.5.10) is the right choice. The field theoretic mechanism that yields the eqn.s (2.5.12) is realized in a gauge theory whose scalar fields span the space SΓ for a C3/Γ singularity, if we introduce the following superpotential: W = Tr[px py pz] εxyz (2.5.13) With this choice the conditions for the vanishing of the scalar potential are indeed the K ¨ahler moment map equations that we are going to discuss and eqn. (2.5.10) or equivalently (2.5.12). Quiver Lie groups We are interested in determining the subgroup GΓ ⊂ SL(|Γ|,C) (2.5.14) made by those elements that commute with the group Γ. GΓ = {g ∈ SL(|Γ|,C) | ∀γ ∈ Γ : [DR (γ) , Ddef (g)] = 0} (2.5.15) In the above equation DR() denotes the regular representation while Ddef denotes the defining representation of the complex linear group. The two representations, by construction, have the same dimension and this is the reason why equation (2.5.15) makes sense. It is sufficient to impose the defining constraint for the generators of the group on a generic matrix depending on |Γ|2 parameters: this reduces it to a specific matrix depending on |Γ|-parameters. The further condition that the matrix should have determinant one, reduces the number of free parameters to|Γ|− 1. In more abstract terms we can say that the group GΓ has the following general structure: GΓ = r+1O µ=1 GL(nµ,C) \\ SL(|Γ|,C) (2.5.16) This is a perfectly analogous result to that displayed in eqn. (2.4.27) for the Kronheimer case. The difference is that there we had unitary groups while here we are talking about general linear complex groups with a holomor- phic action on the quiver coordinates. The reason is that we have not yet introduced a K ¨ahler structure on the quiver space HomΓ (R, Q⊗R): we do it presently and we shall realize that isometries of the constructed K¨ahler metric will be only those elements of GΓ that are contained in the unitary subgroup mentioned below: FΓ ≡ r+1O µ=1 U(nµ) \\ SU(|Γ|) ⊂ GΓ (2.5.17) The holomorphic quiver group and the reduction to V|Γ|+2 Yet the group GΓ plays an important role in understanding the rationale of the holomorphic constraint (2.5.10). The key item is the coset GΓ/FΓ. Let us introduce some notations. Relaying on eqn. (2.5.5) we define the diagonal embedding: D : GL (|Γ|,C) → GL(3|Γ|,C) (2.5.18) 40∀M ∈ GL(|Γ|,C) ; D[M] ≡   M 0 0 0 M 0 0 0 M   (2.5.19) In this notation, the invariance condition that defines SΓ = HomΓ(R,Q×R) can be rephrased as follows: ∀γ ∈ Γ : Q[γ]p = D[R−1 γ ]pD[Rγ] (2.5.20) It is clear that any|Γ|×| Γ| - matrix M that commutes with Rγ realizes an automorphism of the spaceSΓ, namely it maps it into itself. The groupGΓ is such an automorphism group. In particular equation (2.5.10) or alternatively (2.5.12) is invariant under the action of GΓ. Hence the locus: DΓ ⊂ SΓ DΓ ≡ {p ∈ SΓ | [A,B] = [B,C] = [C,A] =0} (2.5.21) is invariant under the action of GΓ. A priori the locus DΓ might be empty, but this is not so because there exists an important solution of the constraint (2.5.10) which is the obvious analogue of the space LΓ defined for the C2/Γ-case in eqn. (2.4.34). In full analogy we set: SΓ ⊃ LΓ ≡      A0 B0 C0   ∈ SΓ | A0,B0,C0 are diagonal in the natural basis of R : {eδ }    (2.5.22) Obviously diagonal matrices commute among themselves and they do the same in any other basis where they are not diagonal, in particular in the split basis. By definition we name in this way the basis where the regular representation R is split into irreducible representations. A general result in finite group theory tells us that every ni-dimensional irrep DDDi appears in R exactly ni-times: R = rM i=0 ni DDDi ; dim DDDi ≡ ni (2.5.23) 41In the split basis every element γ ∈ Γ is given by a block diagonal matrix of the following form: R(γ) =   1 0 ... ... 0 1 0 a1,1 ... a1,n1 ... ... ... an1,1 ... an1,n1 0 ... ... 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 ... ... 0 b1,1 ... b1,nr−1 ... ... ... bnr−1,1 ... bnr−1,nr−1 0 0 ... ... ... 0 c1,1 ... c1,nr ... ... ... cnr,1 ... cnr,nr   (2.5.24) In analogy to what was noticed for the Kronheimer case, the space LΓ has complex dimension three (in Kron- heimer case it was two): dimC LΓ = 3 (2.5.25) Indeed if we fix the first diagonal entry of each of the three matrices, the invariance condition (2.5.20) deter- mines all the other ones uniquely. In any other basis the number of parameters remains three. Let us call them (a0,b0,c0). Because of the above argument and, once again, in full analogy with the Kronheimer case, we can conclude that the space LΓ is isomorphic to the singular orbifold C3/Γ, the Γ-orbit of a triple (a0,b0,c0) representing a point in C3/Γ. The existence of the solution of the constraint (2.5.10) provided by the complex three-dimensional space LΓ shows that we can construct a variety of dimension |Γ|+2 which is in the kernel of the constraint (2.5.10). This is just the orbit, under the action of GΓ of LΓ. We set: DΓ ≡ OrbitGΓ (LΓ) (2.5.26) The counting is easily done. 1. A generic point in LΓ has the identity as stability subgroup in GΓ. 2. The group GΓ has complex dimension |Γ|− 1, hence we get: dimC (DΓ) =|Γ|− 1 +3 = |Γ|+2 (2.5.27) In the sequel we define the variety V|Γ|+2 to be equal to D0 Γ. The coset GΓ/FΓ and the K¨ahler quotient It is now high time to introduce the K¨ahler potential of the original 3|Γ|-dimensional complex flat manifold SΓ. We set: KSΓ ≡ Tr \u0000 p† p \u0001 = Tr \u0000 A† A \u0001 + Tr \u0000 B† B \u0001 + Tr \u0000 C† C \u0001 (2.5.28) 42Using the matrix elements of A,B,C as complex coordinates of the manifold and naming λi the independent parameters from which they depend in a given explicit solution of the invariance constraint, the K¨ahler metric is defined, as usual, by: ds2 SΓ = gℓm dλℓ ⊗dλ m (2.5.29) where: gℓm = ∂ℓ ∂m K (2.5.30) From eqn. (2.5.28) we easily see that the K ¨ahler potential is invariant under the unitary subgroup of the quiver group defined by: FΓ = \b M ∈ GΓ | M M† = 1 \t (2.5.31) whose structure was already mentioned in eqn. (2.5.17). The center z(FΓ) of the Lie algebra FΓ has dimension r, namely the same as the number of nontrivial conjugacy classes of Γ and it has the following structure: z(FΓ) =u(1)⊕u(1)⊕···⊕ u(1)| {z } r (2.5.32) Since FΓ acts as a group of isometries on the space SΓ we might construct the K¨ahler quotient of the latter with respect to the former, yet we may do better. In the case of an abelian |Γ| the center z[F] =F coincides with the entire gauge algebra. Let us consider the inclusion map of the variety DΓ into SΓ: ι : DΓ → SΓ (2.5.33) and let us define as K ¨ahler potential and K ¨ahler metric of the locus DΓ the pull backs of the K ¨ahler potential (2.5.28) and of metric (2.5.29) of SΓ, namely let us set: KDΓ ≡ ι⋆ KSΓ (2.5.34) ds2 DΓ = ι⋆ ds2 SΓ (2.5.35) By construction, the isometry group FΓ is inherited by the pullback metric on DΓ and we can consider the K¨ahler quotient: Mζ ≡ DΓ/ /ζ FΓ (2.5.36) Let fI be a basis of generators of FΓ (I = 1,..., |Γ|− 1) and let Zi (i = 1,..., |Γ|+ 2) be a system of complex coordinates spanning the points of DΓ. By means of the inclusion map we have: ∀Z ∈ DΓ : ι(Z) =p(Z) =   A(Z) B(Z) C(Z)   (2.5.37) The action of the gauge group FΓ on DΓ is implicitly defined by: p(δIZ) =δIp(Z) =   [ fI , A(Z)] [ fI , B(Z)] [ fI , C(Z)]   (2.5.38) 43and the corresponding real moment maps are easily calculated: µI(Z,Z) =Tr \u0000 fI \u0002 A(Z),A†(Z) \u0003\u0001 + Tr \u0000 fI \u0002 B(Z),B†(Z) \u0003\u0001 + Tr \u0000 fI \u0002 C(Z),C†(Z) \u0003\u0001 (2.5.39) One defines the level sets by means of the equation: µ−1 (ζ) = \b Z ∈ DΓ ∥ µI(Z,Z) =0 if fI ̸∈ Z ; µI(Z,Z) =ζI if fI ∈ Z \t (2.5.40) which, by construction, are invariant under the gauge group FΓ and we can finally set: Mζ ≡ µ−1 (ζ)/ /FΓ ≡ DΓ/ /ζ FΓ (2.5.41) The real and complex dimensions ofMζ are easily calculated. We start from|Γ|+2 complex dimensions, namely from 2|Γ|+ 4 real dimensions. The level set equation imposes |Γ|− 1 real constraints, while the quotiening by the group action takes other |Γ|− 1 parameters away. Altogether we remain with 6 real parameters that can be seen as 3 complex ones. Hence the manifolds Mζ are always complex three-folds that, for generic values of ζ, are smooth: supposedly the crepant resolutions of the singular orbifold. Forζ = 0 the manifold M0 degenerates into the singular orbifold C3/Γ, since the solution of the moment map equation is given by the FΓ orbit of the locus LΓ, namely: µ−1 (0) =OrbitFΓ (LΓ) (2.5.42) Comparing eqn. (2.5.26) with eqn. (4.2.1) we are led to consider the following direct sum decomposition of the Lie algebra: GΓ = FΓ ⊕KΓ (2.5.43) [FΓ , FΓ] ⊂ FΓ ; [FΓ , KΓ] ⊂ KΓ ; [KΓ , KΓ] ⊂ FΓ (2.5.44) where FΓ is the maximal compact subalgebra and KΓ denotes its complementary orthogonal subspace with respect to the Cartan Killing metric. A special feature of all the quiver Groups and Lie Algebras is that FΓ and KΓ have the same real dimension |Γ|− 1 and one can choose a basis of hermitian generators TI such that: ∀ΦΦΦ ∈ FΓ : ΦΦΦ = i ×∑ |Γ|−1 I=1 cIT I ; cI ∈ R ∀KKK ∈ KΓ : KKK = ∑ |Γ|−1 I=1 bIT I ; bI ∈ R (2.5.45) Correspondingly a generic element g ∈ GΓ can be split as follows: ∀g ∈ GΓ : g = U H ; U ∈ FΓ ; H ∈ exp[KΓ] (2.5.46) Using the above property we arrive at the following parametrization of the space DΓ DΓ = OrbitFΓ (exp[KΓ]·LΓ) (2.5.47) where, by definition, we have set: p ∈ exp[KΓ]·LΓ ⇒ p = {exp[−KKK] A0 exp[KKK], exp[−KKK] B0 exp[KKK], exp[−KKK] C0 exp[KKK]} {A0, B0, C0} ∈ LΓ KKK = KΓ (2.5.48) Relying on this, in the K ¨ahler quotient we can invert the order of the operations. First we quotient the action of 44the compact gauge group FΓ and then we implement the moment map constraints. We have: DΓ/ /FΓ = exp[KΓ]·LΓ (2.5.49) Calculating the moment maps on exp[KΓ]·LΓ and imposing the moment map constraint we find: µ−1 (ζ)/ /FΓ = \b Z ∈ exp[KΓ]·LΓ ∥ µI(Z,Z) =0 if fI ̸∈ Z ; µI(Z,Z) =ζI if fI ∈ Z \t (2.5.50) Eq. (4.2.12) provides an explicit algorithm to calculate the K ¨ahler potential of the final resolved manifold if we are able to solve the constraints in terms of an appropriate triple of complex coordinates. Furthermore for each level parameter ζa we have to find the appropriate one-parameter subgroup of GΓ that lifts the corresponding moment map from the 0-value to the generic value ζ. Indeed we recall that the K ¨ahler potential of the resolved variety is given by the celebrated formula: KM = π⋆ KN + ζICIJ ΦΦΦJ (2.5.51) where, by definition: π : N → M (2.5.52) is the quotient map and exp[ζI CIJ ΦΦΦI] ∈ exp[KΓ] ⊂ GΓ is the element of the quiver group which lifts the moment maps from zero to the values ζI, while CIJ is a constant matrix whose definition we discuss later on. Indeed the rationale behind formula (4.2.13) requires a careful discussion, originally due to Hitchin, Karlhede, Lindstr ¨om and Roˇcek [40] which we shall review in later sections. 2.5.3 Divisors and line bundles A prime divisor in a complex manifold or algebraic varietyX is an irreducible closed codimension one subvariety of X. A divisor D is a locally finite formal linear combination D = ∑ i ai Di (2.5.53) where the ai are integers, and the Di are prime divisors. A prime divisor D can be descrived by a collection {(Uα, fα)}, where {Uα} is an open cover of X, and the {fα} are holomorphic functions on Uα such that fα = 0 is the equation of D ∩Uα in Uα. As a consequence, the functions gαβ = fα/ fβ are holomorphic nowhere vanishing functions gαβ : Uα ∩Uβ → C∗ that on triple intersections Uα ∩Uβ ∩Uγ satisfy the cocycle condition gαβ gβγ = gαγ and therefore define a line bundle L(D). If D is a divisor as in (2.5.53) then one sets L(D) = O i L(Di)ai . The inverse correspondence (from line bundles to divisors) is described as follows. Ifs is a nonzero meromorphic section of a line bundleL, and V is a codimension one subvariety ofX over which s has a zero or a pole, denoted by ordV (s) the order of the zero, or minus the order of the pole; then D = ∑ V ordV (s)·V 45is a divisor, whose associated line bundle L(D) is isomorphic to L. 2.6 The generalized Kronheimer construction for C3 Γ and the Tautological Bun- dles In the present section we aim at extracting a general scheme from the detailed discussions presented in the previous sections. Our final goal is to establish all the algorithmic steps that give a precise meaning to each of the lines appearing in the conceptual diagram of eqn. (2.3.2). 2.6.1 Construction of the space Nζ ≡ µ−1(ζ) Summarizing the points of our construction we have the following situation. We have considered the moment map µ : SΓ − →FΓ∗ (2.6.1) where FΓ∗ is the dual of the Lie algebra of the maximal compact subgroup FΓ of the quiver group GΓ. Next we have considered the center of the above Lie algebra z[FΓ]⊂FΓ and its dual z[FΓ]∗. The moment map can be restricted to the subspace: DΓ ⊂ SΓ ; DΓ ≡ { p ∈ SΓ| p ∧ p = 0} (2.6.2) which is just the orbit, with respect to the quiver group GΓ, of a locus EΓ ⊂ SΓ of complex dimension three obtained in the following way. Consider the following subspace of S[0,0] Γ ⊂ SΓ S[0,0] Γ = { p ∈ SΓ| p ∧ p = 0 ; µ(p) =0} (2.6.3) whose elements are triples of |Γ|×| Γ| complex matrices (A,B,C) satisfying, by the above definition, in addition to the invariance constraint (4.1.9-4.1.10) also the following two ones: [A,B] = [B,C] = [C,A] =0 ; Tr \u0002 TI \u0000\u0002 A,A†\u0003 + \u0002 B,B†\u0003 + \u0002 C,C†\u0003\u0001\u0003 = 0 ; I = 1,..., |Γ|− 1 (2.6.4) Since the action of the compact group FΓ leaves both the first and the second constraint invariant, it follows that it maps the locus S[0,0] Γ into itself FΓ : S[0,0] Γ → S[0,0] Γ (2.6.5) The locus EΓ is defined as the quotient: EΓ ≡ S[0,0] Γ FΓ (2.6.6) which turns out to be of complex dimension three and to be isomorphic to the singular orbifold : S[0,0] Γ FΓ ≃ C3 Γ (2.6.7) Choosing a representative in each equivalence class S[0,0] Γ FΓ simply amounts to a choice of local coordinates on C3 Γ which will be promoted to a system of local coordinates on the manifold Mζ of the final resolved singularity. We have a canonical algorithm to construct a canonical coordinate system for EΓ which originates from Kronheimer and from the 1994 paper by Anselmi, Bill `o, Fr`e, Girardello and Zaffaroni on ALE manifolds and conformal field theories [4]. The construction is the following. We begin with the locus LΓ ⊂SΓ defined as the 46set of triples ( Ad,Bd,Cd) such that the invariance constraint (4.1.10) is satisfied with respect to Γ and they are diagonal in the natural basis of the regular representation. We have shown on the basis of several examples that : DΓ = OrbitGΓ (LΓ) (2.6.8) We obtain an explicit parameterization of the locusEΓ by solving the algebraic equation for the hermitian matrix V0 ∈ exp[KΓ], such that ∀p ∈ LΓ : µ (V0.p) =0 (2.6.9) The important thing is that the solution for the above equation is a constant matrixV0, indipendent from the point p ∈ LΓ. Then we fix the coordinates of our manifold by parameterizing p ∈ EΓ ⇒ p =   A0 B0 C0   =   V0−1AdV0 V0−1BdV0 V0−1CdV0   where   Ad Bd Cd   ∈ LΓ (2.6.10) It follows that equation (2.6.8) can be substituted by V|Γ|+2 ≡ DΓ = OrbitGΓ (EΓ) (2.6.11) We can also introduce a subspace DΓ0⊂V|Γ|+2 which is the orbit of EΓ under the compact subgroup FΓ: DΓ0 = OrbitFΓ (EΓ) (2.6.12) This being the case we consider the restriction of the moment map to DΓ µ : DΓ − →FΓ∗ (2.6.13) and given an element ζ ∈ z[FΓ]∗ (2.6.14) we define: Nζ ≡ µ−1(ζ) ⊂ DΓ : Nζ = { p ∈ DΓ|µ(p) =ζ} (2.6.15) Obviously we have: N0 ≡ µ−1(0) =DΓ0 (2.6.16) 2.6.2 The space Nζ as a principal fibre bundle The space Nζ has a natural structure of an FΓ principal line bundle over the quotient Mζ : Nζ π− →Mζ ≡ Nζ / /FΓ (2.6.17) On the tangent space to the total space of the FΓ–bundle TN ζ we have a metric induced, as the pullback, by the inclusion map: ι : Nζ − →SΓ (2.6.18) of the flat metric g on SΓ gN = ι∗ (gSΓ ) (2.6.19) 47Since the metric gSΓ is K ¨ahlerian we have a K ¨ahler potential KSΓ from which it derives and we define the function KN ≡ ι∗ (KSΓ ) (2.6.20) This function is not the K¨ahler potential of Nζ which is not even K¨ahlerian (it has odd dimensions) but it will be related to the K ¨ahler potential of the final quotient Mζ by means of an argument due to [40], that we spell out a few lines below. Let us denote by p ∈ Mζ a point of the base manifold and by π−1(p) the FΓ-fibre over that point. The natural connection and the tautological bundles We can determine a natural connection on the principal bundle (2.6.17) through the following steps. As it is observed in eqn. (2.7) of the paper by Degeratu and Walpuski [26], which agrees with the formulae of the present paper, the quiver group has always the following form: GΓ = r ∏ I=1 GL \u0010 Cdim[DDDI ] \u0011 (2.6.21) where DDDI are the nontrivial irreducible representations of the finite groupΓ, with the exclusion ofDDD0, the identity representation. It also follows that the compact gauge subgroup FΓ has the corresponding following structure FΓ = r ∏ I=1 U(dim[DI]) (2.6.22) Consequently, the principal bundle (2.6.17) induces holomorphic vector bundles of rank dim [DDDI] on which the compact structural group acts non-trivially only with its component U (dim[DDDI]). A natural connection on these bundles is obtained as it follows A = i 2 \u0010 H −1∂H −H ∂H −1 \u0011 +g−1dg ∈ r ⊕ I=1 u(dim[DI]) (2.6.23) where H is a hermitian fibre–metric on the direct sum of the tautological vector bundles defined below: R ≡ rM I=1 RI ; RI π− →Mζ ; ∀p ∈ Mζ : π−1(p) ≃ Cdim[DI ] (2.6.24) By definition the matrix H must be of dimension dim[H ] =n ×n where n = r ∑ I=1 dim[DI] = r ∑ I=1 nI (2.6.25) In order to find the hermitian matrix H , we argue in the following way. First we observe that in the regular representation R each irreducible representation DDDI is contained exactly dim [DDDI] times, so that the form of the 48matrix V corresponding to the hermitian parametrization of the coset GΓ FΓ has always the following form: V =   H0 0 0 ... 0 0 H1 ⊗111n1×n1111n1×n1111n1×n1 0 ... ... 0 0 H2 ⊗111n2×n2111n2×n2111n2×n2 ... ... ... ... ... ...... ... ... ... ... ... 0 0 ... ... 0 Hr ⊗111nr×nr111nr×nr111nr×nr   (2.6.26) where nI denotes the dimension of the I-th nontrivial representation of the discrete group Γ and from this we extract the block diagonal matrix: H ≡   H1 0 ... ... 0 0 H2 ... ... ... ... ...... ...... ... ... ... ...... ... Hr−1 0 0 ...... ... 0 Hr   (2.6.27) The hermitian matrix H is the fibre metric on the direct sum: R = rM I=1 RI (2.6.28) of the r tautological bundles that, by construction, are holomorphic vector bundles with rank equal to the dimen- sion of the r irreducible representations of Γ: RI π− →Mζ ; ∀p ∈ Mζ : π−1(p) ≈ CnI (2.6.29) The compatible connection12 on the holomorphic vector bundle R is given by: ϑ = H −1 ∂H = rM I=1 θI θI = H−1 I ∂HI ∈ GL(nI,C) (2.6.30) where GL(nI,C) is the Lie algebra of GL (nI,C) which is the structural group of the I-th tautological vector bundle. The natural connection of the FΓ principal bundle, mentioned in eqn. (2.6.23) is just, according to a universal scheme, the imaginary part of the holomorphic connection ϑ. The tautological bundles from the irrep viewpoint and the K¨ahler potential From the analysis of the above section we have reached a very elegant conclusion. Once the matrix V is calculated as function of the level parameters ζ and of the base-manifold coordinates ( zm,zm) (m = 1,2,3), we 12Following standard mathematical nomenclature, we call compatible connection on a holomorphic vector bundle, one whose (0,1) part is the Cauchy Riemann operator of the bundle 49also have the block diagonal hermitian matrix H which encodes the hermitian fibre metrics Hi(ζ,z,z) on each of the tautological holomorphic bundlesVI whose ranks are equal, one by one, to the dimensions nI of the irreps of Γ. The first Chern classes of these bundles are represented by the differential (1,1) forms: ωI(1,1) = i 2π ∂∂ Log[Det[HI]] (2.6.31) Let us recall another remarkable group theoretical fact. The number r of nontrivial irreps of Γ is equal to the number r of nontrivial conjugacy classes and to the number r of generators of the center of the compact Lie algebra FΓ, hence also to the number r of level parameters ζ and to number r of holomorphic tautological bundles. Now we are in a position to derive in full generality the formula for the K¨ahler potential and, hence, for the K¨ahler metric of the resolved manifold Mζ that we anticipated in (4.2.13) . In view of the above discussion, we rewrite the latter as it follows: KMζ = KSΓ |Nζ +ζICIJLog[Det[HJ]] (2.6.32) where KSΓ is the K ¨ahler potential of the flat space SΓ and |Nζ denotes its restriction to the level surface Nζ , while CIJ is an r×r constant matrix whose structure we will define and determine below. Why the matrix defined there yields the appropriate K ¨ahler potential is what we will now explain starting from an argument introduced in 1987 by Hitchin, Karlhede, Lindstr¨om and Roˇcek. The HKLR differential equation and its solution Before explaining the origin of the matrix CIJ, we would like to stress that, conceptually it encodes a pairing between the level parameters ( = generators of the Lie algebra center) and the tautological bundles ( = irreps). If we could understand the relation between conjugacy classes with their ages and cohomology classes, then we would have a relation between irreps and conjugacy classes and we could close the three-sided relation diagram among the center z[FΓ ] and the other two items, irreps and conjugacy classes. As we are going to show, this side of the relation is based on the concept of weighted blowup. On the other hand, understanding the matrix CIJ, is a pure Lie algebra theory issue, streaming from the HKLR argument. Hence, continuing such an argument, let us consider the flat K¨ahler manifold SΓ and its K¨ahler potential K = 3 ∑ i=1 Tr h Ai , A† i i where we have defined Ai = {A,B,C} (2.6.33) The exponential of the K¨ahler potential is also, by definition, the hermitian metric on the Hodge line bundle: LHodge π− →SΓ where ∀p ∈ SΓ : π−1(p) ≈ C∗ ∥W∥2 ≡ eKS WW (2.6.34) Indeed, the second line of the above equation ∥W∥2 defines the invariant norm of any section of LHodge. Let us know consider the action of the quiver group on SΓ and its effect on the fibre metric h= eK . The maximal compact subgroup FΓ is an isometry group for the K¨ahler metric defined by (2.6.33). Hence we focus on the orthogonal (with respect to the Killing form) complement of FΓ. Let ΦΦΦ ∈ KΓ (2.6.35) be an element of the orthogonal subspace to the maximal compact subalgebra GΓ = FΓ ⊕KΓ (2.6.36) 50consider the one parameter subgroup generated by this Lie algebra element g(λ) ≡ eλΦΦΦ (2.6.37) The action of this group on the K¨ahler potential is easily calculated KS (λ) = 3 ∑ i=1 Tr h Aie2λΦΦΦA† i e−2λΦΦΦ i (2.6.38) Performing the derivative with respect to λ we obtain ∂λ KS (λ) |λ=0= 3 ∑ i=1 Tr \u0010 ΦΦΦ h Ai,A† i i\u0011 (2.6.39) Then we utilize the fact that each elementΦΦΦ ∈ KΓ is just equal to i×ΦΦΦc where ΦΦΦc denotes an appropriate element of the compact subalgebra. Hence the above equation becomes ∂λ KS (λ) |λ=0= i × 3 ∑ i=1 Tr \u0010 ΦΦΦc h Ai,A† i i\u0011 = iPΦΦΦc (2.6.40) Let us decompose the moment map along the standard basis of compact generators. We obtain: PΦ = |Γ|−1 ∑ I=1 ΦΦΦITr \u0010 Kc I h Ai,A† i i\u0011 = i |Γ|−1 ∑ I=1 ΦΦΦI cPI(p) = |Γ|−1 ∑ I=1 ΦΦΦIPI(p) = |Γ|−1 ∑ I=1 ΦΦΦITr \u0010 KI h Ai,A† i i\u0011 (2.6.41) where p ∈DΓ ⊂ SΓ denotes the arbitrary point in the ambient space described by the triple of matrices Ai, KI=i Kc I are the |Γ|-1 noncompact generators of the quiver group GΓ that, by construction, are just as many as the compact generators Kc I of the maximal compact subgroup FΓ. Formally integrating the above differential equation it follows that the fibre of the metric Hodge line bundle (2.6.34) h(p) ≡ Exp[KS (p)] (2.6.42) transforms in the following way under the action of the quiver group ∀g ∈ GΓ g : h(p) − →hg(p) ≡ h \u0010 eLog[g] p \u0011 = ec(g,p)h(p) (2.6.43) where Log[g] ∈ GΓ (2.6.44) is an element of the quiver group Lie algebra and as such can be decomposed along a complete basis of generators Log[g] = 7 ∑ I=1 ΦΦΦIKI +ΦΦΦcIKcI (2.6.45) and the anomaly c(g, p)introduced in eqn. (2.6.43) has, in force of the differential equation discussed above the following form: c(g, p) = 7 ∑ I=1 \u0000 ΦΦΦI +iΦΦΦcI\u0001 PI(p) (2.6.46) 51where PI(p) are the moment maps at point p. Next consider the diagram SΓ ι← −Nζ π− →Mζ ≡ Nζ /FΓ (2.6.47) where Nζ is the level surface and Mζ the final K ¨ahler threefold with its associated Hodge line bundle whose curvature is the K¨ahler form KM KM ≡ i 2π ∂∂ KM = i 2π ∂ \u0012 1 hM ∂hM \u0013 (2.6.48) KM being the K¨ahler potential of the resolved variety. Following HKLR, we require that π∗KM = ι∗KSΓ (2.6.49) where KSΓ is the K ¨ahler form of the flat K ¨ahler manifold SΓ =HomΓ(Q⊗R,R). At the level of fibre metric on the associated Hodge line bundles, eqn. (2.6.49) amounts to stating that ∀p ∈ Mζ : hM (p) =hg SΓ (p) =hSΓ (g.p) =ec(g,p) hSΓ (p) (2.6.50) where g is an element of the quiver group that brings the point p ∈ Nζ on the level surface of level ζ to the reference level surface N0 which corresponds to the singular orbifold C3 Γ . Applying this to eqn. (2.6.46) we obtain: c(g, p) =ζIΦΦΦI(p) =ζI ∗Tr[KILog[g]] = r ∑ i=1 ζI ∗Tr \u0002 Kcentral I Log[g] \u0003 (2.6.51) since the only non-vanishing levels are located in the Lie Algebra center. On the oher hand we have g = H : Tr \u0002 Kcentral I Log[H ] \u0003 ≡ r ∑ J=1 CIJLog[Det[HJ]] (2.6.52) The above formula defines the constant matrix CIJ and justifies the final formula (2.6.32). In the case of cyclic Γ the center of the Lie Algebra FΓ coincides with the algebra itself and the matrix CIJ is just diagonal and essentially trivial. Expansion to first order Performing a series expansion of the 2-forms (1) ω I(1,1) in the ζ parameters: ω(1,1) I = 0 + ∞ ∑ n=1 ζn(n) ω I(1,1) (2.6.53) in those few cases where explicit calculations can be performed one verifies that the order one term is cohomol- ogous to the full form ω(1,1) i . Hence it suffices to solve the moment map equations at first order in ζ (which is always possible) and one obtains a calculation of the cohomology classes of the resolved variety according to the above displayed scheme. At the same time one obtains a calculation of the K¨ahler potential to the very same order. This is a general feature applying to all cases. Dolbeault cohomology The objects we are dealing with are Dolbeault cohomology classes of the final resolved manifold Mζ which is K¨ahler as a result of its K¨ahler quotient construction. When we say that ωp,q is a harmonic representative of a nontrivial cohomology class in H1,1 \u0000 Mζ \u0001 we are stating that: 52• The form is ∂-closed and ∂-closed ∂ω p,q = ∂ω p,q = 0 • There do not exist forms φ p−1,q and φ p,q−1 such that: ωp,q = ∂φ p−1,q = ∂φ p,q−1 The reason why the ω(1,1) I are nontrivial representatives of (1,1) cohomology classes is that they are obtained as ∂ of connection one-forms θ(1,0) that are not globally defined. Indeed if we introduce the curvatures and the first Chern classes of the tautological vector bundles we have the elegant formula anticipated in eqn. (2.6.31): ΘI = ∂θI ω(1,1) I ≡ c1(RI) =Tr(ΘI) =∂ ∂log[Det(HI)] (2.6.54) Comparing now with the definition of Dolbeault cohomology we see that ω(1,1) I are nontrivial cohomology classes because either θ(1,0) I ≡ ∂ log[Det(HI)] or θ(0,1) I ≡ ∂ log[Det(HI)] (2.6.55) are non-globally defined 1-forms on the base manifold. This is so because they transform nontrivially from one local trivialization of the bundle to the next one. The transition functions on the connections are determined by the transition functions on the metric H , namely on the coset representative. Here comes the delicate point. Where from in the Kronheimer–like construction do we know that there are different local trivializations, otherwise that the tautological bundles are nontrivial? Computationally we solve the algebraic equations for H in terms of the coordinates zi (i = 1,2,3) parameterizing the locus LΓ, which is equivalent to the singular locus C3 Γ and we find H = H (ζ,z) where ζ are the level parameters. In order to conclude that the tautological bundle is nontrivial we should divide the locus LΓ into patches and find the transition functions of the connections θI from one patch to the other. Obviously the transition function must be an element of the the quiver groupg ∈ GΓ. At the first sight it is not clear how to implement such a program, since we do not know how we should partition the locus LΓ. Clearly the actual solution of the algebraic equations is complicated and, as we very well know, we are able to implement it only by means of a power series in ζ, yet it is obvious that this is not a case by case study. As everything else in the Kronheimer–like construction, it must be based on first principles and it is precisely these first principles that we are going to find out. It is at this level that the issue of ages is going to come into play in an algorithmic way. 2.6.3 The exceptional divisor According to general lore, the cohomology classes constructed as first Chern classes of the tautological holo- morphic vector bundles defined by the K ¨ahler quotient via hermitian matrices HI, are naturally associated with the components of the exceptional divisor produced by the blow–up of the singularities. This latter is defined as the vanishing locus of a global holomorphic section W(p) of a line bundle: LD π− →Mζ D ⊂ Mζ ; D = \b p ∈ Mζ | W(p) =0 where W ∈ Γ(LD) \t (2.6.56) The line bundle LD is singled out by the divisor D and for this reason it is labeled by it. Its first Chern class ω(1,1) D is certainly a cohomology class and so it must be a linear combination of the first Chern classes ω(1,1) I created by the K¨ahler quotient and associated with the hermitian matrices HI(ζ, p): h ω(1,1) D i = SD,I h ω(1,1) I i (2.6.57) 53The question is to know which is which and to determine the constant matrix SD,I. Another point is that, at least locally, the entire space Mζ can be viewed as the total space of a line bundle over the divisor D: Mζ πd − →D ∀p ∈ D ; π−1 d (p) ≃ C⋆ (2.6.58) Furthermore the matrix HI can be viewed as the invariant norm of a section of the appropriate line bundle: HI(ζ,z,z) =HI(ξ,ξ,W,W)|W|2 (2.6.59) where ξ denote the two coordinates spanning the divisor D and W spans the vertical fibres out of the divisor. The projection πd corresponds to setting W → 0 and obtaining: πd : H(ξ,ξ,W,W) − →h(ξ,ξ) ≡ H(ξ,ξ,0,0) (2.6.60) We expect that the two (1,1)-forms: ΩI = ∂∂ HI(ξ,ξ,W,W) bΩI = ∂∂ h(ξ,ξ) (2.6.61) should be cohomologous: [ΩI] = h bΩI i (2.6.62) The form bΩI is the first Chern class of the line bundle (2.6.58) whileΩI is the first Chern class of the line bundle (2.6.56) that defines the divisor. Divisors and conjugacy classes graded by age. Hence the question boils down to the following:What are the components of the exceptional divisor of a crepant resolution of the singularity C3/Γ, and how many are they? The answer is provided by Theorem 2.3.1 (Theorem 1.6 in [39]); they are the inverse images via the blowdown morphism of the irreducible components of the fixed locus of the action of Γ on C3, and are in a one-to-one correspondence with the junior conjugacy classes of Γ. The irreducible components of the exceptional divisor may be compact (corresponding to a component of the fixed locus which is just the origin ofC3) or noncompact (corresponding to fixed loci of higher dimensions, i.e., curves). Let us consider the case of a cyclic group Γ, with only the origin as fixed locus, and choose a generator γ of Γ of order r. As in eqn. (2.3.7), we can write γ = 1 r (a1,a2,a3). As described in [39], sections 2.3 and 2.4, the resolution of singularities is obtained by iterating the following construction, which uses toric geometry (a general reference for toric geometry, which in particular explains how to perform a toric blowup by subdividing the fan of the toric variety one wants to blowup, is [48]). The fan of the toric variety C3 is the first octant of R3, with all its faces; by adding the ray 1 r (a1,a2,a3) we perform a blowup B[a1,a2,a3] → C3 whose exceptional divisor F is the weighted projective space WP[a1,a2,a3]. The same procedure applied to C3/Γ produces a partial desingularization Wγ → C3/Γ which is the base of a cyclic covering B[a1,a2,a3] → Wγ, ramified along the exceptional divisor E of Wγ → C3/Γ. The situation is summarised by the following diagram F \u001f  /  \u000f \u000f  B[a1,a2,a3] weighted blowup / /  \u000f \u000f  C3 \u000f \u000f  E\u001f  / Wγ crepant resolution / / C3/Γ . (2.6.63) 54The full desingularization is obtained by performing a multiple toric blowup, adding all rays corresponding to junior conjugacy classes. 2.6.4 Steps of a weighted blowup The present section is devoted to give some views on the relation between the age grading and the cohomology classes of the resolved variety (to get more extensive information see [17]). Weighted projective planes Let us define in a pedantic way the weighted blowup of the origin in C3. To this effect we begin by recalling the definition of a weighted projective plane WP[a1,a2,a3], where [a1,a2,a3] are the weights (good references for weighted projective spaces and line bundles on them are [49, 50, 51]). We restrict our attention to the case where the weights are integers. One defines an action of C∗ on C3 −{0} letting (y1,y2,y3) → (y1 λa1 ,y2 λa2 ,y3 λa2 ), λ ∈ C∗. The weighted projective plane WP[a1,a2,a3] is the quotient of C3 −{0} under this action. It is by construction a complex variety of dimension 2. To examine the properties of this space it is expedient to assume that the triple (a1,a2,a3) is reduced. One defines di = g.c.d.(ai−1,ai+1), bi = l.c.m.(di−1,di+1) (where indices in the r.h.s. are meant mod 3, i.e., 1−1 = 3, etc.). The triple (a1,a2,a3) is reduced if (b1,b2,b3) = (1,1,1); otherwise one defines a′ i = ai/bi. The numbers a′ i are positive integers, the triple (a′ 1,a′ 2,a′ 3) is reduced, and the weighted projective planes WP[a1,a2,a3] and WP[a′ 1,a′ 2,a′ 3] are isomorphic. Henceforth we shall assume that the triple (a1,a2,a3) is reduced. It turns out that WP[a1,a2,a3] is smooth if and only if (a1,a2,a3) = (1,1,1), in which case the weighted projective plane is just P2. The same construction of line bundles on projective spaces produces on weighted projective spaces rank one sheaves OWP[a1,a2,a3] (i), with i ∈ Z, that in general are not locally free (i.e., they are not line bundles), but only reflexive (i.e., they are isomorphic to their duals). It turns out that OWP[a1,a2,a3] (i) is locally free if and only if i is a multiple of m = l.c.m.(a1,a2,a3) [50]. The weighted projective plane WP[a1,a2,a3] is covered by the open sets Ui = {(y1,y2,y3)|yi ̸= 0}. On this open cover the line bundle OWP[a1,a2,a3] (km) has transition functions gi j : Ui ∩Uj → C∗, gi j(y1,y2,y3) =ykm/aj j y−km/ai i (2.6.64) where m = l.c.m. (a1,a2,a3). In particular, (the isomorphism class of) OWP[a1,a2,a3] (m) is the (very ample) gener- ator of the Picard group of WP[a1,a2,a3], the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on WP[a1,a2,a3], which is isomorphic to Z. We conclude this brief introduction to weighted projective planes by defining an orbifold K¨ahler metric for the spaces WP[a1,a2,a3]. Denoting again by (y1,y2,y3) a set of homogeneous coordinates on WP[a1,a2,a3], and m = l.c.m.(a1,a2,a3), one can check the 2-form ω = i 2π ∂∂ log 3 ∑ i=1 ym/ai i ym/ai i 55is invariant under rescaling of the homogeneous coordinates, and therefore defines a 2-form on the smooth locus of WP[a1,a2,a3]; this reduces to the usual Fubini-Study form when the projective space is smooth. The weighted blowup and the tautological bundle The weighted blowup of C3, denoted B[a1,a2,a3], is a subvariety B[a1,a2,a3] ⊂ C3 ×WP[a1,a2,a3] (2.6.65) defined by the equations z1ya1a3 2 = z2ya2a3 1 , z2ya1a2 3 = z3ya1a3 2 , z1ya1a2 3 = z3ya2a3 1 (2.6.66) where {z1,z2,z3} are standard coordinates in C3, and {y1,y2,y3} are homogenous coordinates in WP[a1,a2,a3]. Actually the three equations are not independent (regarding them as a linear system in the unknowns z, the associated matrix has rank at most 2) and therefore the locus B[a1,a2,a3] is 3-dimensional. The projections of C3 ×WP[a1,a2,a3] onto its factors define projections p : B[a1,a2,a3] → C3 π : B[a1,a2,a3] → WP[a1,a2,a3] From eqn. (2.6.66) we see that the fibres of π are isomorphic to C; indeed, by comparing with eqn. (2.6.64), we see that B[a1,a2,a3] is the total space of the line bundle OWP[a1,a2,a3] (−1) over the base WP[a1,a2,a3], and π is the bundle projection. On the other hand, the morphism p is birational, as it is an isomorphism away from the fibre p−1(0), while the fibre itself — the exceptional divisor F of the blowup — is isomorphic to WP[a1,a2,a3]. The blowup B[a1,a2,a3] is nicely described in terms of toric geometry [48]. Denoting by{ei} the standard basis of R3, the variety B[a1,a2,a3] is associated with the fan given by the one-dimensional cones (rays) generated by e1, e2, e3, v = a1e1 +a2e2 +a3e3. The fan has three 3-dimensional cones σi, corresponding to 3 open affine toric varietiesUi which cover B[a1,a2,a3] (see Figure 2.3). It turns out that Ui is smooth if and only if ai = 1, so that B[a1,a2,a3] is smooth if and only if a1 = a2 = a3 = 1 (in which case the exceptional divisor is aP2). Moreover, unless again a1 = a2 = a3 = 1, F is a Weil divisor, so that its associated rank one sheaf (it ideal sheaf, i.e., the sheaf of functions B[a1,a2,a3] that vanish on F), is not locally free, but only reflexive. We shall denote the dual of this sheaf as OB[a1,a2,a3] (F). Although this in general is not locally free, it is still true that its first Chern class is Poincar´e dual to F. Let us assume that we are interested in desingularizing a quotient C3/Γ, where Γ is cyclic, and the represen- tation of Γ on C3 has just one junior class 1 r (a1,a2,a3), which is compact, i.e., all ai are strictly positive. The geometric constructions in this section show that the orbifold K ¨ahler form on WP[a1,a2,a3] induce by pullback a K¨ahler form on the smooth locus of the blowup B[a1,a2,a3]. With reference to diagram (2.6.63), the action of the group Γ leaves the exceptional divisor F pointwise fixed, so that the form descends to the desingularization Mζ of C3/Γ. However, this K ¨ahler form does not appear to coincide with the K ¨ahler form built on Mζ by means of the K ¨ahler reduction. This comes to no surprise as it is known that there are several different metrics on a weighted projective space which all reduce to the standard Fubini-Study metric in the smooth case (see [52]). Pairing between irreps and conjugacy class in the K¨ahler quotient resolution: open questions According to [39], in the crepant resolution: Mζ − →C3 Γ (2.6.67) 56e1 e2 e3 v σ3 σ2 σ1 Figure 2.3: Representation of the fan of B[a1,a2,a3]. The vector v is not on the plane singled out by e1, e2, e3. we obtain a component of the exceptional divisor D(E) for each junior conjugacy class of the group Γ, namely we have: D(E) = # of junior classes[ i=1 D[a1,a2,a3]i (2.6.68) When there is just one junior class, the procedure described in previous subsections, which is graphically summa- rized in the diagram (2.6.63), is exhaustive and we easily identify the exceptional divisor with a single projective plane WP[a1,a2,a3]. Indeed, the divisor F is the weighted projective plane WP[a1,a2,a3] by construction, and the action of Γ leaves it pointwise fixed, so that E is isomorphic to F. Utilizing the correspondence between line bundles and divisors, we can conclude that the exceptional divisor WP[a1,a2,a3] uniquely identifies a line-bundle, i.e., the tautological line bundle T[a1,a2,a3], whose first Chern class is necessarily given by: c1 \u0000 T[a1,a2,a3] \u0001 = i 2π ∂ ∂log \u0000 H[a1,a2,a3] \u0001 (2.6.69) where H[a1,a2,a3] is a suitable hermitian fibre-metric. The most interesting issue is to relate such an invariant fibre metric and the (1,1)-form c1 \u0000 T[a1,a2,a3] \u0001 with the real functions HI in eqn.(4.2.17) and the corresponding (1,1)-forms (2.6.31), that are produced by the K¨ahler quotient construction. In the next section which is the first of the second part such a relation will be explicitly analyzed in the context of a simple master example that indeed is characterized by a unique junior conjugacy class. The construction of the exceptional divisor and the structure of the blowup in cases with several junior classes is more complicated. 57Chapter 3 A fully calculable master example: C3/Z3 In this part I focus on the simplest available non-trivial example of resolution `a la Kronheimer of a C3/Γ singu- larity which, being fully calculable, allows to illustrate all the so far introduced concepts in a transparent way. An additional advantage of such a master example is that the Ricci flat metric on the resolved three-fold Y Γ [3] can also be explicitly worked out and compared with the HKLR metric emerging from the K¨ahler quotient. 3.1 The master model The master model is provided by quotient singularity C3 Z3 in the case where the generator Y of Z3 is of the following form: Y =   ξ 0 0 0 ξ 0 0 0 ξ   (3.1.1) ξ being a primite cubic root of unity ξ3 =1. 3.2 Analysis of the (1,1)-forms: irreps versus conjugacy classes that is cohomol- ogy versus homology In the present section following [17] I illustrate in full detail, within the scope of the one junior class model defined above by eqn.(3.1.1), the relation between the above extensively discussedω(1,1) I forms (I = 1,..., r = # of nontrivial irreps), with the exceptional divisors generated by the blowup of the singularity, together with the other predictions of the fundamental theorem 2.3.1 which associates cohomology classes of Mζ with conjugacy classes of Γ. The number of nontrivial conjugacy classes and the number of nontrivial irreps are equal to each other so that we user in both cases, yet what is the actual pairing is not clear a priori and it is not intrinsic to group theory, as we have stressed several times. It is desirable to explore such pairing in an explicit way and for that we need explicit calculable examples. These are very few because of the bottleneck constituted by the solution of the moment map equations, that are algebraic of higher degree and only seldom admit explicit analytic solutions. For this reason we introduce here the full-fledged construction of one of those rare examples, where the moment map equations are solved in terms of radicals. As anticipated above this model has the additional nice feature that the number of junior conjugacy classes is just one. It is our master model for explicit analysis. Such a master model that we discuss here is based onΓ = Z3 the action of the latter onC3 being degined in eqn.(3.1.1). It is also important to stress that aim of the Kronheimer-like construction is not only the calculation of cohomology but 58also the actual determination of the K ¨ahler potential (yielding the K ¨ahler metric), which is encoded in formula (2.6.32). From this point of view one of the DetHi may lead to a correspondingω(1,1) I = i 2π ∂∂ DetHI that is either exact or cohomologous to another one, yet its contribution to the K ¨ahler potential, which is very important in physical applications, can not be neglected. It is only the cohomology class of the K¨ahler 2-form that is affected by the triviality of one or more of the ω(1,1) I ; the contributions to the K¨ahler potential that give rise to exact form deformations of the K¨ahler 2-form are equally important as others. Having anticipated these general considerations we turn to the construction of the master model. 3.3 The master model C3 Γ with generator {ξ,ξ,ξ} In this section we develop all the calculations for the K ¨ahler quotient resolution corresponding to the Z3 action defined on C3 as in eqn.(3.1.1). In this case the equationp∧ p=0 which is a set of quadrics has solutions arranged in various branches. There is a unique, principal branch of the solution that has maximal dimension D0 Γ and is indeed isomorphic to the GΓ orbit of the singular locus LΓ . This principal branch is the algebraic variety V|Γ|+2 mentioned in eqn. (2.1.36), of which we perform the K¨ahler quotient with respect to the group FΓ FΓ = r+1 ⊗ µ=1 U \u0000 nµ \u0001 ∩SU(|Γ|) =U(1)⊗U(1) (3.3.1) in order to obtain the crepant resolution together with its K ¨ahler metric. In the above formula nµ = {1,1,1} are the dimensions of the irreducible representations of Γ=Z3 and r+1=3 is the number of conjugacy classes of the group (r is the number of nontrivial representations). To make a long story short, exactly as in the original Kronheimer case we are able to retrieve the algebraic equation of the singular locus from traces and determinants of the quiver matrices restricted to LΓ. Precisely for the Z3 case under consideration we obtain I1 = Det[Ao];I2 = Det[Bo]; I3 = Det[Co];I4 = 1 3Tr[AoBoCo] (3.3.2) and we find the relation I1I2I3 = I43 (3.3.3) which reproduces the C3 analogue of eqs. (2.4.37-2.4.39) applying to the C2 case of Kronheimer and Arnold. The main difference, as we have several time observed, is that now the same equations remain true, with no deformation for the entireGΓ = C∗ × C∗ orbit of the locusLΓ, namely for the entire V|Γ|+2 = V5 variety of which we construct the K ¨ahler quotient with respect to the compact subgroup U (1) ×U(1) ⊂ C∗ ×C∗. This is in line with the many times emphasized feature that in the C3 case there is no deformation of the complex structure. 3.3.1 The actual calculation of the K ¨ahler quotient and of the K¨ahler potential The calculation of the final form of the K ¨ahler potential is reduced to the solution of a set of two algebraic equations. The solutions of such equations are accessible in this particular case since they reduce to a single cubic for which we have Cardano’s formula. For this reason the present case is the three-dimensional analogue of the Eguchi-Hanson space where everything is explicitly calculable and all theorems admit explicit testing and illustration. By calculating the ages we determine the number of ω(q,q) harmonic forms (where q = 1,2). According to theorem 2.3.1 all these forms (and their dual cycles in homology) should be in one-to-one correspondence with the r nontrivial conjugacy classes of Γ. On the other hand the K ¨ahler quotient construction associates one level parameter ζ to each generator of the center z(FΓ) of the group FΓ, two ζ.s in this case, that are in one-to-one 59correspondence with the r nontrivial irreducible representation of Γ. The number is the same, but what is the pairing between irrepsirrepsirreps and conjugacy classesconjugacy classesconjugacy classes? More precisely how do we see the homology cycles that are created when each of the r level parameters ζ departs from its original zero value? Using the explicit expression of the functions H1,2 defined in eqs. (2.6.26-2.6.31) we arrive at the calculation of the ω(1,1)I=1,2 forms that encode the first Chern classes of the two tautological bundles. The expectation from the age argument is that these two 2-forms should be cohomologous corresponding to just the unique predicted class of type (1,1) since h1,1=1. On the other hand we should be able to construct an ω(2,2) form representing the unique class that is Poincar´e dual to the exceptional divisor. In this case we can successfully answer both questions and this is very much illuminating. Ages. Indeed taking the explicit generator Y =   (−1)2/3 0 0 0 (−1)2/3 0 0 0 (−1)2/3   (3.3.4) we easily calculate the {a1,a2,a3} vectors respectively associated to each of the three conjugacy classes and we obtain: a −vectors = {{0,0,0}, 1 3 {1,1,1}, 1 3 {2,2,2}} (3.3.5) from which we conclude that, apart from the class of the identity, there is just one junior and one senior class. Hence we conclude that the Hodge numbers of the resolved variety should beh(0,0) = 1, h(1,1) = 1, h(2,2) = 1. If we follow the weighted blowup procedure described in section 2.6.4 using the weights of the unique junior class {1,1,1}, we see that the projection π of eqn. (2.6.67) yields π : B(1,1,1) − →WP(1,1,1) ∼ P2 (3.3.6) So the blowup replaces the singular point 0 ∈ C3 with a P2, which is compact. As a result, also the exceptional divisor in the resolutionMζ is compact. By Poincar´e duality this entrains the existence of a harmonic (2,2)–form associated with the unique senior class. The quiver matrix In this case, the quiver matrix defined by eqn. (2.5.1) is the following one : Ai j =   0 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0   (3.3.7) and it has the graphical representation displayed in fig. 3.1 60U2(N) U3(N) U1(N)U1(N) Figure 3.1: The quiver diagram of the diagonal embedding of the group Z3 → SU(3) The space SΓ = HomΓ(Q⊗R,R) in the natural basis Solving the invariance constraints (4.1.10) in the natural basis of the regular representation we find the triples of matrices {A,B,C} spanning the locus SΓ. They are as follows: A =   α1,1 α1,2 α1,3 (−1)2/3α1,3 (−1)2/3α1,1 (−1)2/3α1,2 −(−1)1/3α1,2 −(−1)1/3α1,3 −(−1)1/3α1,1   B =   β1,1 β1,2 β1,3 (−1)2/3β1,3 (−1)2/3β1,1 (−1)2/3β1,2 −(−1)1/3β1,2 −(−1)1/3β1,3 −(−1)1/3β1,1   C =   γ1,1 γ1,2 γ1,3 (−1)2/3γ1,3 (−1)2/3γ1,1 (−1)2/3γ1,2 −(−1)1/3γ1,2 −(−1)1/3γ1,3 −(−1)1/3γ1,1   (3.3.8) The locus LΓ. The locus LΓ ⊂ SΓ is easily described by the equation: A0 =   α1,1 0 0 0 (−1)2/3α1,1 0 0 0 −(−1)1/3α1,1   B0 =   β1,1 0 0 0 (−1)2/3β1,1 0 0 0 −(−1)1/3β1,1   C0 =   γ1,1 0 0 0 (−1)2/3γ1,1 0 0 0 −(−1)1/3γ1,1   (3.3.9) 61The space SΓ in the split basis Solving the invariance constraints in the split basis of the regular representation we find another representation of the triples of matrices {A,B,C} that span the space SΓ. They are as follows: A =   0 0 m1,3 m2,1 0 0 0 m3,2 0   B =   0 0 n1,3 n2,1 0 0 0 n3,2 0   C =   0 0 r1,3 r2,1 0 0 0 r3,2 0   (3.3.10) The equation p ∧ p = 0 and the characterization of the variety V5 = DΓ Here we are concerned with the solution of eqn. (2.5.12) and the characterization of the locus DΓ. Differently from the more complicated cases of larger groups, in the present abelian case of small order, we can explicitly solve the quadratic equations provided by the commutator constraints and we discover that there is a principal branch of the solution, named D0 Γ that has indeed dimension 5= |Γ|+2. In addition however there are several other branches with smaller dimension. These branches describe different components of the locus DΓ. Actually as already pointed out they are all contained in the GΓ orbit of the subspace LΓ defined above. The quadratic equations defining DΓ have a set of 14 different solutions realized by a numberni of constraints on the 9 parameters. Hence there are 14 branches Di Γ(i=0,1,...16) of dimensions: dimC Di Γ = 9 −ni (3.3.11) The full dimension table of these branches is displayed below {5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2} As we see, there is a unique branch that has the maximal dimension 5 = |Z3|+ 2. This is the principal branch D0 Γ. It can be represented by the substitution: n2,1 → m2,1n1,3 m1,3 , n3,2 → m3,2n1,3 m1,3 , r2,1 → m2,1r1,3 m1,3 , r3,2 → m3,2r1,3 m1,3 (3.3.12) In this way we have reached a complete resolution of the following problem: how to obtain an explicit parametriza- tion of the variety V|Γ|+2. This variety is described by the following three matrices depending on the 5 complex 62variables ωi (i=1,...,5): A =   0 0 ω1 ω2 0 0 0 ω3 0   B =   0 0 ω4 ω2ω4 ω1 0 0 0 ω3ω4 ω1 0   C =   0 0 ω5 ω2ω5 ω1 0 0 0 ω3ω5 ω1 0   (3.3.13) The quiver group Our next point is the derivation of the group GΓ defined in eqs. (2.5.14) and (2.5.15), namely: GΓ = {g ∈ SL(|Γ|,C)|∀γ ∈ Γ : [DR(γ),Ddef(g)] =0} (3.3.14) Let us proceed to this construction. In the diagonal basis of the regular representation this is a very easy task, since the group is simply given by the diagonal 3×3 matrices with determinant one. We introduce such matrices g ∈ GΓ : g =   a1 0 0 0 a2 0 0 0 a3   (3.3.15) V5 as the orbit under GΓ of the locus LΓ In this section we want to verify and implement eqn. (2.1.36), namely we aim at showing that V5=DΓ = OrbitGΓ (LΓ). To this effect we rewrite the locus LΓ in the diagonal split basis of the regular representation. The change of basis is performed by the character table of the cyclic group Z3. The result is displayed below: A0 =   0 0 α1,1 α1,1 0 0 0 α1,1 0   B0 =   0 0 β1,1 β1,1 0 0 0 β1,1 0   C0 =   0 0 γ1,1 γ1,1 0 0 0 γ1,1 0   (3.3.16) 63Eventually the complex parameters z1 ≡ α1,1; z2 ≡ β1,1; z3 ≡ γ1,1 (3.3.17) will be utilized as complex coordinates of the resolved variety when the level parameters ζ1,2 are switched on. Starting from the above the orbit is given by: OrbitGΓ ≡ \b\b gA0 g−1,gB0 g−1,gC0 g−1\t | ∀ g ∈ GΓ , ∀{A0,B0,C0} ∈LΓ \t ⊃ D0 Γ (3.3.18) and the correspondence between the parameters of the principal branch D0 Γ and the parameters spanning GΓ and LΓ is provided below: a1 → ω1/3 2 ω1/3 1 ,a2 → ω1/3 3 ω1/3 2 ,a3 → ω1/3 1 ω1/3 3 ,z1 → ω1/3 1 ω1/3 2 ω1/3 3 ,z2 → ω1/3 2 ω1/3 3 ω4 ω2/3 1 ,z3 → ω1/3 2 ω1/3 3 ω5 ω2/3 1 (3.3.19) Branches of smaller dimension of the solution are all contained in the Orbit GΓ (LΓ) and correspond to the orbits of special points of LΓ where some of the zi vanish or satisfy special relations among themselves. Hence, indeed we have: OrbitGΓ = DΓ The compact gauge group FΓ = U(1)2 We introduce a basis for the generators of the compact subgroup U (1)2 = FΓ ⊂ GΓ provided by the set of two generators displayed here below T 1 =   i 0 0 0 −i 0 0 0 0   ; T 2 =   0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 −i   (3.3.20) whose trace-normalization is the A2 Cartan matrix Tr \u0000 T iT j\u0001 = Cij =   2 −1 −1 2 ! (3.3.21) Calculation of the K¨ahler potential and of the moment maps Naming ∆i the moduli of the coordinates zi and θi their phases according to zi = eiθi ∆i and considering a generic element gR of the quiver group that is real and hence is a representative of a coset class in GΓ FΓ : gR =   eλ1 0 0 0 e−λ1+λ2 0 0 0 e−λ2   ; λ1,2 ∈ R (3.3.22) 64The triple of matrices {A,B,C}= \b gRA0gR−1,gRB0gR−1,gRC0gR−1\t have the following explicit appearance: A =   0 0 eiθ1−λ1−λ2 ∆1 eiθ1+2λ1−λ2 ∆1 0 0 0 eiθ1−λ1+2λ2 ∆1 0   B =   0 0 eiθ2−λ1−λ2 ∆2 eiθ2+2λ1−λ2 ∆2 0 0 0 eiθ2−λ1+2λ2 ∆2 0   C =   0 0 eiθ3−λ1−λ2 ∆3 eiθ3+2λ1−λ2 ∆3 0 0 0 eiθ3−λ1+2λ2 ∆3 0   (3.3.23) Calculating the K¨ahler potential we find KS |D = \u0000 Tr \u0002 A, A†\u0003 +Tr \u0002 B, B†\u0003 +Tr \u0002 C , C†\u0003\u0001 = e−2(λ1+λ2) \u0010 1 +e6λ1 +e6λ2 \u0011\u0000 ∆2 1 +∆2 2 +∆2 3 \u0001 (3.3.24) We have used the above notation since Tr \u0002 A,A†\u0003 +Tr \u0002 B,B†\u0003 +Tr \u0002 C,C†\u0003 is the K¨ahler potential of the ambient space SΓ restricted to the orbit DΓ. Indeed since FΓ is an isometry of SΓ, the dependence in KS |D is only on the real part of the quiver group, namely on the real factors λ1,2. Just as it stands, KS |D cannot work as K¨ahler potential of a complex K¨ahler metric. Yet, when the real factors λ1,2 will be turned into functions of the complex coordinates zi, then KS |D will be enabled to play the role of a contribution to the K ¨ahler potential of the resolved manifold Mζ . Next we calculate the moment maps according to the formulas: P1 ≡ −iTr \u0002 T 1 \u0000\u0002 A,A†\u0003 + \u0002 B,B†\u0003 + \u0002 C,C†\u0003\u0001\u0003 = e−2(λ1+λ2) \u0010 1 −2e6λ1 +e6λ2 \u0011\u0000 ∆2 1 +∆2 2 +∆2 3 \u0001 P2 ≡ −iTr \u0002 T 2 \u0000\u0002 A,A†\u0003 + \u0002 B,B†\u0003 + \u0002 C,C†\u0003\u0001\u0003 = e−2(λ1+λ2) \u0010 1 +e6λ1 −2e6λ2 \u0011\u0000 ∆2 1 +∆2 2 +∆2 3 \u0001 (3.3.25) Solution of the moment map equations In order to solve the moment map equations it is convenient to introduce the new variables ϒ1,2 = exp[2λ1,2] (3.3.26) and to redefine the moment maps with indices lowered by means of the inverse of the Cartan matrix mentioned above PI = \u0000 C−1\u0001 IJPJ (3.3.27) In this way imposing the level condition PI = −ζI (3.3.28) where ζ1,2 > 0 are the two level parameters, we obtain the final pair of algebraic equations for the factors ϒ1,2 ( Σ \u0000 −1 +ϒ3 1 \u0001 ϒ1ϒ2 , Σ \u0000 −1 +ϒ3 2 \u0001 ϒ1ϒ2 ) = {ζ1,ζ2} (3.3.29) 65where we have introduced the shorthand notation: Σ = 3 ∑ i=1 |zi|2 (3.3.30) The above algebraic system composed of two cubic equations is simple enough in order to find all of its nine roots by means of Cardano’s formula. The very pleasant property of these solutions is that one and only one of the nine branches satisfies the correct boundary conditions, namely provides real ϒI(ζ,Σ) that are positive for all values of Σ and ζ and reduce to 1 when ζ→0. The complete solution of the algebraic equations can be written in the following way. For the first factor we have: ϒ1 = 1 61/3 \u0012 N Σ3Π 1 3 \u00131 3 (3.3.31) where N = 2 ×21/3ζ3 1 ζ2 2 +6Σ3Π 1 3 +2ζ2 1 \u0010 3 ×21/3Σ3 +ζ2Π 1 3 \u0011 +ζ1 \u0010 6 ×21/3Σ3ζ2 +22/3Π 2 3 \u0011 Π = 27Σ6 +9Σ3 ζ2 1 ζ2 +9Σ3 ζ1ζ2 2 +2ζ3 1 ζ3 2 +3 √ 3Σ3 R R = q 27Σ6 +6Σ3ζ1ζ2 2 −ζ4 1 ζ2 2 −4Σ3ζ3 2 +ζ3 1 \u0000 −4Σ3 +2ζ3 2 \u0001 +ζ2 1 \u0000 6Σ3ζ2 −ζ4 2 \u0001 (3.3.32) For the second factor we have ϒ2 = −M8/3 Σ5 + 18M5/3 Σ2 −72M2/3Σ+36 \u0000M Σ3 \u00012/3 ζ3 1 −36 \u0000M Σ3 \u00012/3 ζ2 1 ζ2 +6 \u0000M Σ3 \u00015/3 ζ2 1 ζ2 36 ×62/3 Σ2ζ1 (3.3.33) where M = 6Σ3Π1/3 +22/3Π2/3ζ1 +6 ×21/3Σ3 ζ2 1 +6 ×21/3Σ3 ζ1ζ2 +2Π1/3ζ2 1 ζ2 +2 ×21/3ζ3 1 ζ2 2 Ω1/3 (3.3.34) 3.3.2 Discussion of cohomology in the master model Since the two scale factors ϒ1,2 are functions only of Σ, the two (1,1)-forms, relative to the two tautological bun- dles, respectively associated with the first and second nontrivial irreps of the cyclic group, defined in eqn. (2.6.31) take the following general appearance: ω(1,1) 1,2 = i 2π \u0012 d dΣLog[ϒ1,2(Σ)]dzi ∧dzi + d2 dΣ2 Log[ϒ1,2(Σ)]zjzidzi ∧dzj \u0013 = i 2π ( f1,2Θ + g1,2Ψ) (3.3.35) where we have introduced the short hand notation Θ = 3 ∑ i=1 dzi ∧dzi ; Ψ = 3 ∑ i, j=1 zj zidzi ∧dzj (3.3.36) Indeed in the present case the fibre metrics H1,2 are one-dimensional and given by H1,2 = p ϒ1,2. The most relevant point is that the two functions f1,2 and g1,2 being the derivatives (first and second) of ϒ1,2 depend only on the variable Σ. 66It follows that a triple wedge product of the two–forms ω(1,1) a (a=1,2) has always the following structure: ω(1,1) a ∧ω(1,1) b ∧ω(1,1) b = \u0012 i 2π \u00133 ( fa fb fc +2Σ (ga fb fc +gb fc fa +gc fa fb))×V ol (3.3.37) where V ol= dz1 ∧dz2 ∧dz3 ∧dz1 ∧dz2 ∧dz3 (3.3.38) This structure enables us to calculate intersection integrals of the considered forms very easily. It suffices to change variables as we explain below. The equations Σ = 3 ∑ i=1 |zi|2 = ρ2 (3.3.39) define 5-spheres of radius ρ. Introducing the standard Euler angle parametrization of a 5-sphere, the volume form (3.3.38) reduces to: V ol= 8iρ5 cos4 (θ1)cos3 (θ2)cos2 (θ3)cos(θ4) 5 ∏ i=1 dθi (3.3.40) The integration on the Euler angles can be easily performed and we obtain: 4 ∏ i Z π 2 π 2 dθi Z 2π 0 dθ5 \u0000 8iρ5 cos4 (θ1)cos3 (θ2)cos2 (θ3)cos(θ4) \u0001 = 8iπ3ρ5 (3.3.41) Hence defining the intersection integrals: Iabc = Z M ω(1,1) a ∧ω(1,1) b ∧ω(1,1) b (3.3.42) we arrive at Iabc = \u0012 i 2π \u00133 ×8iπ3 × Z ∞ 0 \u0000 6ρ5 fa fb fc +2ρ7 ( fb fcga + fa fcgb + fa fbgc) \u0001 dρ = Z ∞ 0 \u0000 6ρ5 fa fb fc +2ρ7 ( fb fcga + fa fcgb + fa fbgc) \u0001 dρ (3.3.43) We have performed the numerical integration of these functions and we have found the following results (ζ1 > 0,ζ2 = 0) : I111 = 1 8 (ζ1 = 0,ζ2 ≥ 0) : I111 = 0 (ζ1 > 0,ζ2 > 0) : I111 = 1 (3.3.44) From this we reach the following conclusion. Since the corresponding integral is nonzero it follows that: ω(2,2) S ≡ ω(1,1) 1 ∧ω(1,1) 1 (3.3.45) is closed but not exact and by Poincar´e duality it is the Poincar´e dual of some cycle S ∈ H2(M) such that: Z S ι∗ω(1,1) 1 = Z M ω(1,1) 1 ∧ω(2,2) S (3.3.46) 67where ι : S − →M (3.3.47) is the inclusion map. Since H2 c (M)= H2(M) and both have dimension 1 it follows that dim H2(M) = 1, so that every nontrivial cycle S is proportional (as homology class) via some coefficient α to a single cycle C, namely we have S= α C. Then we can interpret eqn. (29) as follows Z αC ι∗ω(1,1) 1 = α Z M ω(1,1) 1 ∧ω(2,2) C (3.3.48) If we choose as fundamental cycle, that one for which Z C ι∗ω(1,1) 1 = 1 (3.3.49) we conclude that α = ( 1 case{ζ1 > 0,ζ2 > 0} 1 8 case{ζ1 > 0,ζ2 = 0} (3.3.50) Next we have calculated the intersection integral I211 and we have found: (ζ1 > 0,ζ2 = 0) : I211 = 0 (ζ1 = 0,ζ2 ≥ 0) : I211 = 0 (ζ1 > 0,ζ2 > 0) : I211 = 1 (3.3.51) Conclusions on cohomology. We have two cases. case{ζ1 > 0,ζ2 > 0}. The the first Chern classes of the two tautological bundles are cohomologous: h ω(1,1) 1 i = h ω(1,1) 2 i = h ω(1,1) i (3.3.52) case{ζ1 > 0,ζ2 = 0}. The the first Chern class of the first tautological bundle is nontrivial and generates H(1,1) c (M) = H1,1(M). h ω(1,1) 1 i = nontrivial (3.3.53) The the first Chern class of the second tautological bundle is trivial , namely ω(1,1) 2 = exact form (3.3.54) Obviously since there is symmetry in the exchange of the first and second scale factors, exchanging ζ1↔ζ2, the above conclusion is reversed in the case {ζ1 = 0,ζ2 > 0}. In passing we have also proved that the unique (2,2)-class is just the square of the unique (1,1)-class h ω(2,2) i = h ω(1,1) i ∧ h ω(1,1) i (3.3.55) The above results reveal the first instance of the chamber structure underlying the Kronheimer resolution ofC3/Γ 68Figure 3.2: The chamber structure of the resolution OP2 (−3) − →C3 Z3 . In the figure we have namedp = ζ1,q = ζ2. singularities. Indeed the above results are summarized in fig.3.2 and in the following table: ζ1 ∈ R, ζ2 > 0 R C ω1 = 1 R C ω2 = 1 ζ1 ∈ R, ζ2 < 0 R C ω1 = 0 R C ω2 = 2 ζ1 ∈ R, ζ2 = 0 R C ω1 = 1 2 R C ω2 = 2 ζ1 = 0, ζ2 ∈ R R C ω1 = 0 R C ω2 = 1 2 (3.3.56) It is evident from table (3.3.56) and from the fig.3.2 that there are two walls corresponding to the two coordinate axes ζ1 = 0 and ζ2 = 0, respectively. The exceptional divisor Finally let us discuss how we retrieve the exceptional divisorP2 predicted by the weighted blowup argument. As we anticipated in eqs. (2.6.59-2.6.60), replacing the three coordinates zi with z1 = W ; z2 = W ξ1 ; z3 = W ξ2 (3.3.57) which is the appropriate change for one of the three standard open charts of P2, we obtain H1(Σ) = 1 |W|2 H1(ξ,ξ,W,W) (3.3.58) where the function H1(ξ,ξ,W,W) has the property that: lim W→0 log[H1(ξ,ξ,W,W)] =−log[1 +|ξ1|2 +|ξ2|2]+ log[const] (3.3.59) 69From the above result we conclude that the exceptional divisor D(E) is indeed the locus W = 0 and that on this locus the first Chern class of the first tautological bundle reduces to the K¨ahler 2-form of the Fubini-Study K¨ahler metric on P2. Indeed we can write: c1 (L1)|D(E) = − i 2π ∂ ∂log[1 +|ξ1|2 +|ξ2|2] (3.3.60) From this point of view this master example is the perfect three-dimensional analogue of the Eguchi-Hanson space, the P1 being substituted by a P2. 3.4 Further discussion of the master model as a gauge theory From the geometrical viewpoint the previous master example of the generalized Kronheimer construction of crepant resolutions can be summarized by stating that the crepant resolution is the total space of the following line-bundle: Y Z3 [3] = OP2 (−3) − →C3 Z3 (3.4.1) Furthermore formulae (3.3.10) providing the parametrization of the invariant space SZ3 can be written as fol- lows: A =   0 0 ΦA 1,3 ΦA 2,1 0 0 0 ΦA 3,2 0   ; B =   0 0 ΦB 1,3 ΦB 2,1 0 0 0 ΦB 3,2 0   ; C =   0 0 ΦC 1,3 ΦC 2,1 0 0 0 ΦC 3,2 0   (3.4.2) Interpreting the nine complex matrix entries ΦA,B,C 1,3 , ΦA,B,C 2,1 , ΦA,B,C 3,2 as scalar fields charged with respect to the three gauge groups U 1,2,3(N) according with the quiver diagram structure. Indeed with reference to the quiver diagram of fig.3.1, each of the nine lines corresponds to one of the nine scalar fields in the bi-fundamental representation with respect to the two groups mentioned at its foot. With N we indicate the number of D3- branes. In the case of a single brane (N=1) the quiver group GZ3 has the following structure: GZ3 = C⋆ ⊗C⋆ ≃ C⋆ ⊗C⋆ ⊗C⋆ C⋆ central (3.4.3) and its maximal compact subgroup FZ3 ⊂ GZ3 is the following: FZ3 = U(1)⊗U(1) ≃ U(1)⊗U(1)⊗U(1) U(1)central (3.4.4) The gauge group FZ3 and its complexification FZ3 are embedded into SL (3,C) means of the two generators mentioned in eqn.(3.3.20). 3.4.1 The HKLR K ¨ahler potential The K¨ahler potential of the linear space SZ3 , which in the D3-brane gauge theory provides the kinetic terms of the nine scalar fields ΦA,B,C 1,2,3 is given reinterpreting eqn.(3.3.24) by: K0 (Φ) =Tr \u0000 A† A +B† B +C†C \u0001 (3.4.5) 70where the three matrices A,B,C are those of equation (3.4.2). According with the principles of the Kronheimer construction, the superpotential is given by W (Φ) = const × Tr([A,B] C). The final HKLR K ¨ahler metric, whose determination requires two steps of physical significance: 1. Reduction to the critical surface of the superpotential i.e. ∂Φ W = 0 2. Reduction to the level surfaces of the gauge group moment maps by solving the algebraic moment map equations, is calculated according with the general theory reported in section 2.6.2. The final form of the HKLR K ¨ahler potential is provided by: KHKLR (z,z,ζζζ) = K0 +α ζI CIJ log[ϒJ] = α n (2ζ1 −ζ2)log[ϒ1]−(ζ1 −2ζ2)log[ϒ2] o + Σ \u0000 ϒ3 1 +ϒ3 2 +1 \u0001 ϒ1ϒ2 (3.4.6) where ϒ1,2 were calculated in eqn.s (3.3.31,3.3.32,3.3.33,3.3.34). In relation with the quoted equations we recall that: Σ ≡ |z1|2 +|z2|2 +|z3|2 ; ϒ1,2 = ϒ1,2 = Λ1,2 (Σ,ζζζ) (3.4.7) where z1,2,3 are the three complex coordinates and ζζζ = {ζ1,ζ2} the two Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. 3.4.2 The issue of the Ricci-flat metric One main question is whether the metric arising from the K ¨ahler quotient, which is encoded in eqn. (3.4.6) is Ricci-flat. A Ricci-flat metric on the crepant resolution of the singularity C3/Z3, namely on OP2 (−3), is known in explicit form from the work of Calabi1 [54], yet it is not a priori obvious that the metric defined by the K¨ahler potential (3.4.6) is that one. The true answer is that it is not, as we show later on. Indeed we are able to construct directly the K ¨ahler potential for the resolution of Cn/Zn, for any n ≥ 2, in particular determining the unique Ricci-flat metric on OP2 (−3) with the same isometries as the metric (3.4.6) and comparing the two we see that they are different. Here we stress that the metric defined by (3.4.6) obviously depends on the level parameters ζ1,ζ2 while the Ricci-flat one is unique up to an overall scale factor. This is an additional reason to understand a priori that (3.4.6) cannot be the Ricci flat metric. Actually Calabi in [54] found an easy form of the K ¨ahler potential of a Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle of a K¨ahler-Einstein manifold, and that result applies to the cases of the canonical bundle ofP2. However, in view of applications to cases where we shall consider the canonical bundles of manifolds which are not K¨ahler- Einstein, in this section we stick with our strategy of using the metric coming from the K ¨ahler quotient as a starting point. The Ricci-flat metric on Y[3] = OP2 (−3) As we have noticed above the HKLR K¨ahler metric defined by the K¨ahler potential (3.4.6) depends only on the variable Σ defined in eqn. (3.4.7). It follows that the HKLR K ¨ahler metric admits U (3) as an isometry group, which is the hidden invariance of Σ. The already addressed question is whether the HKLR metric can be Ricci- flat. An almost immediate result is that a Ricci-flat K ¨ahler metric depending only on the sum of the squared moduli of the complex coordinates is unique (up to a scale factor) and we can give a general formula for it. We can present the result in the form of a theorem. 1Such metrics were also re-discovered in the physics literature in [53]. 71Theorem 3.4.1 Let Mn be a non-compact n-dimensional K ¨ahler manifold admitting a dense open coordinate patch zi, i = 1,..., n which we can identify with the total space of the line bundleOPn−1 (−n), the bundle structure being exposed by the coordinate transformation: zi = ui w 1 n , (i = 1,..., n −1) ; zn = w 1 n (3.4.8) where ui is a set of inhomogenous coordinates for Pn−1. The K ¨ahler potential Kn of a U(n) isometric K ¨ahler metric on Mn must necessarily be a real function of the unique real variable Σ = ∑n i=1 |zi|2. If we require that the metric should be Ricci-flat, the K¨ahler potential is uniquely defined and it is the following one: Kn(Σ) =k + (Σn +ℓn)−n−1 n \u0010 (n −1)(Σn +ℓn)−ℓn (Σ−nℓn +1) n−1 n 2F1 \u0000n−1 n , n−1 n ; 2n−1 n ;−ℓnΣ−n\u0001\u0011 n −1 (3.4.9) where k is an irrelevant additive constant and ℓ >0 is a constant that can be reabsorbed by rescaling all the complex coordinates by a factor ℓ, namely zi → ℓezi. Proof 3.4.1.1 The proof of the above statement is rather elementary. It suffices to recall that the Ricci tensor of any K¨ahler metric gi j⋆ = ∂i∂j⋆ K (z,z) can always be calculated as follows: Rici j⋆ [g] =∂i ∂j⋆ log[Det[g]] (3.4.10) In order for the Ricci tensor to be zero it is necessary that Det[g] be the square modulus of a holomorphic function |F(z)|2, on the other hand under the hypotheses of the theorem it is a real function of the real variable Σ. Hence it must be a constant. It follows that we have to impose the equation: Det[g] =ℓ2 = const (3.4.11) Let K (Σ) be the sought for K¨ahler potential, calculating the K¨ahler metric and its determinant we find: Det[g] =Σn−1K (Σ)′ \u0000 Σ2K (Σ)′′ +ΣK (Σ)′\u0001 (3.4.12) Inserting eqn. (3.4.12) into eqn. (3.4.11) we obtain a non linear differential equation forK (Σ) of which eqn. (3.4.9) is the general integral. This proves the theorem. ♢ Particular cases It is interesting to analyze particular cases of the general formula (3.4.9). The case n = 2: Eguchi-Hanson. The case n = 2 yielding a Ricci flat metric onOP1 (−2) is the Eguchi-Hanson case namely the crepant resolution of the Kleinian singularity C2/Z2. This is known to be a HyperK ¨ahler man- ifold and all HyperK ¨ahler metrics are Ricci-flat. Hence also the HKLR metric must be Ricci-flat and identical with the one defined by eqn. (3.4.9). Actually we find: K2(Σ) = \u0000 Σ2 +ℓ2\u0001−1 2 \u0012\u0000 Σ2 +ℓ2\u0001 −ℓ2 \u0000 Σ−2ℓ2 +1 \u00011 2 2F1 \u00121 2, 1 2; 3 2;−ℓ2Σ−2 \u0013\u0013 = p Σ2 +ℓ2 −ℓlog \u0010p Σ2 +ℓ2 +ℓ \u0011 +ℓlog(Σ) +const (3.4.13) which follows from the identification of the hypergeometric function with combinations of elementary transcen- dental functions occurring for special values of its indices. The second transcription of the function is precisely 72the K¨ahler potential of the Eguchi-Hanson metric in its HKLR-form as it arises from the Kronheimer construc- tion. The case n = 3: OP2 (−3). The next case is that of interest for the D3-brane solution. For n = 3, setting ℓ = 1, which we can always do by a rescaling of the coordinates, we find: KR f lat(Σ) = 2 \u0000 Σ3 +1 \u0001 − \u0000 1 Σ3 +1 \u00012/3 2F1 \u00002 3 , 2 3 ; 5 3 ;− 1 Σ3 \u0001 2(Σ3 +1)2/3 = 2(Σ3 +1)− 2F1 \u0010 2 3 ,1; 5 3 ; 1 Σ3+1 \u0011 2(Σ3 +1)2/3 (3.4.14) The second way of writing the K ¨ahler potential follows from one of the standard Kummer relations among hypergeometric functions. There is a third transcription that also in this case allows to write it in terms of elementary transcendental functions. Before considering it we use eqn. (3.4.14) to study the asymptotic behavior of the K¨ahler potential for large values of Σ. We obtain; KR f lat(Σ) Σ→∞ ≈ Σ− 1 6Σ2 + 1 45Σ5 +O \u0012 1 Σ7 \u0013 (3.4.15) Eq.(3.4.15) shows that the Ricci-flat metric is asymptotically flat since the K ¨ahler potential approaches that of C3. As anticipated, there is an alternative way of writing the K¨ahler potential (3.4.14) which is the following: KR f lat(Σ) = π 2 √ 3 + 1 6 \u0010 6 3 p Σ3 +1 +2log h 3 p Σ3 +1 −1 i −log h\u0000 Σ3 +1 \u00012/3 + 3 p Σ3 +1 +1 i −2 √ 3arctan \" 2 3√ Σ3 +1 +1√ 3 #! (3.4.16) The identity of eqn. (3.4.16) with eqn. (3.4.14) can be worked out with analytic manipulations that we omit. The representation (3.4.16) is particularly useful to explore the behavior of the K¨ahler potential at small values of Σ. We immediately find that: KR f lat(Σ) Σ→0 ≈ log[Σ]+ π 2 √ 3 +O \u0000 Σ6\u0001 (3.4.17) The behavior of KR f lat(Σ) is displayed in fig.3.3. 3.4.3 The harmonic function in the case Y Z3 [3] = OP2 (−3) Let us now consider the equation for a harmonic function H(z,z) on the background of the Ricci-flat metric of Y Z3 [3] that we have derived in the previous sections. Once again we suppose that H = H(Σ) is a function only of the real variable Σ, viz. R = √ Σ. For the Ricci-flat metric the Laplacian equation takes the simplified form: ∂i \u0000 gi j⋆ ∂j⋆ H(Σ) \u0001 = 0, since the determinant of the metric is constant. Using the K¨ahler metric that follows from the K¨ahler potential KR f lat(Σ) defined by eqn.s (3.4.14),(3.4.16), we obtain a differential equation that upon the change of variable Σ = 3√r takes the following form: 3r(r +1)C′′(r)+( 5r +3)C′(r) =0 (3.4.18) 73Figure 3.3: The plot of the K ¨ahler potential KR f lat(Σ) for the Ricci-flat metric on OP2 (−3). The asymptotic flatness of the metric is evident from the plot. For large values of Σ it becomes a straight line with angular coefficient 1. The general integral eqn. (3.4.18) is displayed below: C(r) =κ +λ \u0012 log \u0010 1 − 3√ r +1 \u0011 − 1 2 log \u0010 (r +1)2/3 + 3√ r +1 +1 \u0011 − √ 3tan−1 \u00122 3√r +1 +1√ 3 \u0013\u0013 (3.4.19) κ,λ being the two integration constants. We fix these latter with boundary conditions. We argue in the following way: if the transverse space to the brane were the original C3/Z3 instead of the resolved variety OP2 (−3), then the harmonic function describing the D3-brane solution would be the following: Horb(R) =1 + 1 R4 ; R ≡ √ Σ = s 2 ∑ i |zi|2 = 6√r (3.4.20) The asymptotic identification for R → ∞ of the Minkowski metric in ten dimension would be guaranteed, while at small values of R we would find (via dimensional transmutation) the standard AdS 5-metric times that of S5 (see the following eqn.s (3.4.25) and (3.4.44)). In view of this, naming R the square root of the variable Σ, we fix the coefficients κ,λ in the harmonic function Hres(R) in such a way that for large values of R it approaches the harmonic function pertaining to the orbifold case (3.4.20). The asymptotic expansion of the function: Hres(R) ≡ C(r6) is the following one: Hres(R) R→∞ ≈ \u0012 λ − πκ 2 √ 3 \u0013 − 1 2κ \u00121 R \u00134 +O  \u00121 R \u00135! (3.4.21) 74Figure 3.4: The plot of the harmonic function Hres(R) for the Ricci-flat metric on OP2 (−3). Hence the function Hres(R) approximates the function Horb(R) if we set κ = 2, λ = π√ 3 . In this way we conclude that: Hres(R) = 1 3 \u0010 2log \u0010 3 p R6 +1 −1 \u0011 −log \u0010\u0000 R6 +1 \u00012/3 + 3 p R6 +1 +1 \u0011 −2 √ 3tan−1   2 3√ R6 +1 +1√ 3 !! + π√ 3 (3.4.22) The overall behavior of the function Hres(R) is displayed in fig.3.4. 3.4.4 The asymptotic limits of the Ricci-flat metric for the D3-brane solution on OP2 (−3) In the case of a standard D3-brane on Y[3] = C3 ≃ R6 one writes the same ansatz as in eqn. (2.2.2) and (2.2.26- 2.2.27) where now the K¨ahler metric is gαβ ⋆ = δαβ ⋆ Rewriting the complex coordinates in terms of polar coor- dinates z1 = eiϕ1 Rcosφ, z2 = eiϕ2 Rcos χ sinφ, z3 = eiϕ3 Rsin χ sinφ we obtain that: ds2 C3 ≡ 3 ∑ i=1 |dzi|2 = dR2 +R2 ds2 S5 (3.4.23) where: ds2 S5 = dϕ12 cos2 φ +sin2 φ \u0000 dϕ22 cos2 χ +dϕ32 sin2 χ +dχ2\u0001 +dφ2 (3.4.24) is the SO(6)-invariant metric of a 5-sphere in polar coordinates. In other words the Ricci-flat K¨ahler metric ds2 C3 (which is also Riemann-flat) is that of the metric cone on the Sasaki-Einstein metric of S5. At the same time the SO(6)-invariant harmonic function on C3 is given by the already quoted Horb(R) in (3.4.20), and the complete 10-dimensional metric of the D3-brane solution takes the form: ds2 10|orb = 1q 1 + 1 R4 ds2 Mink1,3 + r 1 + 1 R4 \u0000 dR2 +R2 ds2 S5 \u0001 (3.4.25) 75For R → ∞ the metric (3.4.25) approaches the flat Minkowski metric in d = 10, while for R → 0 it approaches the following metric: ds2 10|orb R→0 ≈ R2 ds2 Mink1,3 + dR2 R2 | {z } AdS5 + ds2 S5 |{z} S5 (3.4.26) Let us now consider the asymptotic behavior of the Ricci-flat metric on OP2 (−3). In order to obtain a precise comparison with the flat orbifold case the main technical point is provided by the transcription of the S5-metric in terms of coordinates well adapted to the Hopf fibration: S5 π− →P2 ; ∀ p ∈ P2 π−1(p) ∼ S1 (3.4.27) To this effect let Y = {u,v} be a pair of complex coordinates for P2 such that the standard Fubini-Study metric on this compact 2-fold is given by: ds2 P2 = gP2 i j⋆ dYi dY j⋆ ≡ dY ·dY 1 +Y ·Y − \u0000 Y ·dY \u0001\u0000 Y ·dY \u0001 \u0000 1 +Y ·Y \u00012 (3.4.28) the corresponding K¨ahler 2-form being KP2 = i 2π gP2 i j⋆ dYi ∧ dY j⋆ . Introducing the one form: Ω = i(Y·dY−Y·dY) 2(1+Y·Y) whose exterior derivative is the K ¨ahler 2-form, dΩ = 2π KP2 , the metric of the five-sphere in terms of these variables is the following one: ds2 S5 = ds2 P2 + (dϕ +Ω)2 (3.4.29) where the range of the coordinate ϕ spanning the S1 fibre is ϕ ∈ [0,2π]. In this way the flat metric on the metric cone on S5, namely (3.4.23) can be rewritten as follows: ds2 C3 = dR2 +R2 ds2 P2 +R2 (dϕ +Ω)2 (3.4.30) Comparison of the Ricci-flat metric with the orbifold metric In order to compare the exact Ricci-flat metric streaming from the K ¨ahler potential (3.4.14) with the metric (3.4.7) it suffices to turn to toric coordinates z1 = u 3√w, z2 = v 3√w, z3 = 3√w ; Σ = (1 +ϖ) f1/3 ; ϖ = |u|2 +|v|2 ; f = |w|2 (3.4.31) The toric coordinates {u,v} span the exceptional divisorP2 while w is the fibre coordinate in the bundle. Setting: w = eiψ|w| = eiψ \u0012 R2 1 +|u|2 +|v|2 \u00133 2 (3.4.32) we obtain: ds2 R f lat = h(R)dR2 + f (R)ds2 P2 + g(R) (dψ +3Ω)2 f (R) = 3 p R6 +1 ; h(R) = R4 (R6 +1)2/3 ; g(R) = R6 9(R6 +1)2/3 (3.4.33) From eqn. (3.4.33) we derive the asymptotic form of the metric for large values of R, namely: ds2 R f lat R→∞ ≈ dR2 +R2ds2 P2 +R2 \u0012dψ 3 +Ω \u00132 (3.4.34) 76The only difference between eqn. (3.4.30) and eqn. (3.4.34) is the range of the angular value ϕ = ψ 3 . Because of the original definition of the angle ψ, the new angle ϕ ∈ \u0002 0, 2π 3 \u0003 takes one third of the values. This means that the asymptotic metric cone is quotiened by Z3 as it is natural since we resolved the singularity C3/Z3. Reduction to the exceptional divisor The other important limit of the Ricci-flat metric is its reduction to the exceptional divisor ED . In the present case the only fixed point for the action of Γ = Z3 on C3 is provided by the origin z1,2,3 = 0 which, comparing with eqn. (3.4.31), means w = 0 ⇒ f = 0. This is the equation of the exceptional divisor which is created by the blowup of the unique singular point. In the basis of the complex toric coordinates {u,v,w}, the K ¨ahler metric derived from the K¨ahler potential (3.4.14) has the following appearance: gR f lat i j⋆ =   vv+f(ϖ+1)4+1 (ϖ+1)2(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 − vu (ϖ+1)2(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 w(ϖ+1)2u 3(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 − uv (ϖ+1)2(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 uu+f(ϖ+1)4+1 (ϖ+1)2(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 w(ϖ+1)2v 3(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 u(ϖ+1)2w 3(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 v(ϖ+1)2w 3(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3 (ϖ+1)3 9(f(ϖ+1)3+1)2/3   (3.4.35) where the invariants f,ϖ are defined in equation (3.4.31). Hence the reduction of the metric to the exceptional divisor is obtained by setting dw = dw = 0 in the line element ds2 R f lat ≡ gR f lat i j⋆ dyi dyj⋆ and performing the limit f → 0 on the result. We obtain: ds2 R f lat ED− →ds2 P2 ≡ dv(dv +uudv −uvdu)+ du(du +vvdu −uv dv) (1 +uu +vv)2 (3.4.36) which is the standard Fubini-Study metric on P2 obtained from the K¨ahler potential: K FS P2 (ϖ) =log(1 +ϖ) (3.4.37) As we see, the metric on the exceptional divisor obtained from the Ricci-flat metric has no memory of the Fayet Iliopoulos (or stability parameters) p,q which characterize instead the HKLR metric obtained from the Kronheimer construction. This is obvious since the Ricci-flat metric does not depend on p,q. On the other hand the HKLR metric, that follows from the K¨ahler potential (3.4.6), strongly depends on the Fayet Iliopoulos parameters ζ1 = p, ζ2 = q and one naturally expects that the reduction of ds2 HKLR to the exceptional divisor will inherit such a dependence. Actually this is not the case since the entire dependence from p,q of the HKLR K¨ahler potential, once reduced to ED , is localized in an overall multiplicative constant and in an irrelevant additive constant. This matter of fact is conceptually very important in view of the following conjecture: Conjecture 3.4.1 The Ricci-flat metric on Y Γ [3] is completely determined in terms of a Monge-Amp `ere equation from the K¨ahler metric on the exceptional divisor ED , as it is determined by the Kronheimer construction. In the present case where, up to a multiplicative constant, i.e. a homothety there is only one Ricci-flat metric on OP2 (−3) with the prescribed isometries, the above conjecture might be true only if the reduction of the HKLR metric to the exceptional divisor were unique and ζ1,ζ2-independent, apart from overall rescalings. It is very much reassuring that this is precisely what actually happens. 3.4.5 Comment on the near-brane geometry Let us analyze conceptually the lesson that we can learn from the present example about the relation between the Ricci flat metric on the canonical bundle over the exceptional divisor and the Ricci flat metric of the metric cone over a 5-dimensional sasakian manifold. To this effect we need to make a recollection of formulae and 77ideas. The exceptional divisor in the resolution of the considered singularity C3/Z3 is the well known manifold P2 which happens to be a coset manifold, but more importantly it is a K ¨ahler Einstein manifold. Hence we can write the following abstract identification: P2 = MKE B (3.4.38) where MKE B is the base manifold of a line bundle: OP2 (−3) =Y Γ [3] π− →MKE B ; ∀p ∈ MKE B π−1(p) ∼ C (3.4.39) On the other hand recalling eqn.(3.4.29) we know that there is another bundle onMKE B = P2. It is a circle-bundle and its total space is the 5-sphere, i.e. a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. S5 = ϒSE eπ− →MKE B ; ∀p ∈ MKE B eπ−1(p) ∼ S1 (3.4.40) The metric on ϒSE is indeed provided by equation eqn.(3.4.29) and we can capture the general meaning of the latter by writing: ds2 ϒSE = ds2 MKE B + \u0010 dψ +qΩMKE B \u00112 (3.4.41) where q is a charge and ΩMKE B is a K ¨ahler U(1) connection on the K ¨ahler Einstein base manifold, namely one has dΩMKE B = 2π KMKE B = 2π κ RicMKE B (3.4.42) where KMKE B is the K¨ahler 2-form and RicMKE B is the Ricci 2-form. They are proportional to each other because of the K ¨ahler Einstein nature of the metric. If we construct the metric cone on the Sasakian Einstein manifold ϒSE its metric is Ricci-flat and we obtain the corresponding D3-brane metric mentioned in eqn.(3.4.25) that we can generalize as it follows ds2 10 = 1q 1 + 1 R4 ds2 Mink1,3 + r 1 + 1 R4 \u0012 dR2 +R2 \u0014 ds2 MKE B + \u0010 dψ +qΩMKE B \u00112\u0015\u0013 (3.4.43) In the near brane limit R → 0 the above metric displays the mechanism of the dimensional transmutation illus- trated in (3.4.44) that we can generalize by rewriting ds2 [10] R→0 ≈ R2 ds2 Mink1,3 + dR2 R2 | {z } AdS5 +ds2 ϒSE (3.4.44) For the exact D3-brane solution based on the Ricci flat metric on Y Γ [3] eqn.(3.4.43) is instead replaced by ds2 10 = H−1/2 res (R)ds2 Mink1,3 + H1/2 res (R) \u0014 h(R)dR2 + f (R)ds2 MKE B + g(R) \u0010 dψ +qΩMKE B \u00112\u0015 (3.4.45) The functions Hres(R), h(R), f (R),g(R) being defined in eqn.(3.4.22) and (3.4.33). It is then evident that in the near brane limit R → 0 there is no dimensional transmutation mechanism and the metric of the Sasakian Einstein manifold ϒSE = S5 does not emerge in any way. This completely calculable example shows the above mentioned general features that we will retrieve also in the more complicated cases studied in chapter 5. 78Chapter 4 A second important example with a much richer structure: C3 Z4 In this chapter I review the results obtained for the application of the Kronheimer construction to the case C3 Z4 . For this case, in [23] the resolution was obtained also by utilizing the independent tools of toric geometry; this allowed a very useful comparison and a extensive study of the chamber structure. In this case the compact component of the exceptional divisor is the second Hirzebruch surface that is known to admit no K¨ahler Einstein metric. As I will report in chapter 5 the absence of K ¨ahler Einstein metrics on the compact exceptional divisor makes it much more complicated to find the Ricci flat metric on the resolved three-fold Y Z4 [3] . 4.1 The C3/Z4 model, its McKay quiver and the associated Kronheimer con- struction The action of the group Z4 on C3 is defined by introducing the three-dimensional unitary representation Q(A) of its abstract generator A that satisfies the defining relation A4 = e. We set: Q(A) =   i 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 −1   ; Q(A)4 =   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   (4.1.1) Since Z4 is abelian and cyclic, each of its four elements corresponds to an entire conjugacy class of which we can easily calculate the age-vector and the ages according with the conventions established in section 2.3.1. We 79obtain: Conj. Class Matrix age-vector age name Id   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   1 4 (0,0,0) 0 null class Q(A)   i 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 −1   1 4 (1,1,2) 1 junior class Q(A)2   −1 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 1   1 4 (2,2,0) 1 junior class Q(A)3   −i 0 0 0 −i 0 0 0 −1   1 4 (3,3,2) 2 senior class (4.1.2) Therefore, according with the theorem of Ito and Reid [28], as reviewed in section 2.3.2, in the crepant resolution: Y Z4 [3] ≡ Mζ − →C3 Z4 (4.1.3) the Hodge numbers of the smooth resolved variety are as follows: h(0,0) \u0000 Mζ \u0001 = 1 ; h(1,1) \u0000 Mζ \u0001 = 2 ; h(2,2) \u0000 Mζ \u0001 = 1 (4.1.4) Furthermore the existence of a senior class implies that one of the two generators ofH(1,1) \u0000 Mζ \u0001 can be chosen to have compact support while the other will have non-compact support. As we later discuss studying the resolution with the help of toric geometry, this distinction goes hand in hand with the structure of the exceptional divisor that has two components, one compact and one non-compact. The character table of the Z4 group is easily calculated and it foresees four one-dimensional representations that we respectively name DI, (I = 0,1,2,3). The table is given below.

(4.1.2), (4.1.5) is sufficient to calculate the McKay quiver matrix defined by: Q⊗DI = 3M J=0 AIJ DJ (4.1.6) 80U1(1) U2(1) D2D1 U0(1) U3(1) D3D0 Figure 4.1: The quiver diagram describing the C3/Z4 singular quotient and codifying its resolution via K ¨ahler quotient `a la Kronheimer. The same quiver diagram codifies the construction of the corresponding gauge theory for a stack of D3-branes. Each node is associated with one of the 4 irreducible representations of Z4 and in each node we located one of the UI(1) groups with respect to which we perform the K¨ahler quotient. This is the case of one D3–brane. For N D3–branes, all gauge groups UI(1) are promoted to UI(N). where DI denotes the 4 irreducible representation of the group defined in eqn. (4.1.5), while Q is the represen- tation (4.1.2) describing the embedding Z4 ,→ SU(3). Explicitly we obtain AIJ =   0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 2 2 1 0 0   (4.1.7) A graphical representation of the quiver matrix (4.1.7) is provided in fig. 4.1. Every node of the diagram corresponds to an irreducible representation DI and, in the Kronheimer construc- tion, to a gauge group factor U(dimDI). As one sees, in every node do enter three lines and go out three lines. Both the incoming and the outgoing lines are subdivided in a double line in some direction (or from some direction) and a single line to some direction, or from some direction. This information is sufficient to derive the number of Wess-Zumino multiplets in the corresponding super- symmetric gauge theory and assign their representations with respect to the three gauge groups (actually four minus one for the barycentric motion). From the mathematical viewpoint each line of the diagram corresponds to an independent parameter appear- ing in the explicit construction of the space SZ4 . This latter is constructed as follows. Let R denote the regular representation of Γ. We consider the space of triplets of 4×4 complex matrices: p ∈ PZ4 ≡ Hom(R,Q⊗R) ⇒ p =   A B C   (4.1.8) The action of the discrete group Z4 on the space PΓ is defined according with the general scheme discussed in 81section 2.5 by: ∀γ ∈ Z4 : γ · p ≡ Q(γ)   R(γ)AR(γ−1) R(γ)BR(γ−1) R(γ)C R(γ−1)   (4.1.9) where R(γ) denotes its 4 ×4-matrix image in the regular representation. The subspace SZ4 is obtained by setting: SZ4 ≡ Hom(R,Q⊗R)Z4 = {p ∈ PZ4 /∀γ ∈ Z4,γ · p = p} (4.1.10) As we know from the general theory exposed in chapter 2 (see section 2.5) the space SZ4 must have complex dimension 3 × |Z4| = 12 which is indeed the number of lines in the quiver diagram of fig. 4.1. In the basis where the regular representation has been diagonalized with the help of the character Table (4.1.5) the general form of the triplet of matrices composing Hom Z4 (R,Q⊗R) and therefore providing the representation of the quiver diagram of fig. 4.1 is the following one: A =   0 0 0 Φ(1) 0,3 Φ(1) 1,0 0 0 0 0 Φ(1) 2,1 0 0 0 0 Φ(1) 3,2 0   ; B =   0 0 0 Φ(2) 0,3 Φ(2) 1,0 0 0 0 0 Φ(2) 2,1 0 0 0 0 Φ(2) 3,2 0   C =   0 0 Φ(3) 0,2 0 0 0 0 Φ(3) 1,3 Φ(3) 2,0 0 0 0 0 Φ(3) 3,1 0 0   (4.1.11) The twelve complex parameters Φ(J) p,q with J = 1,2,3, p,q = 0,1,2,3, promoted to be functions of the space-time coordinates ξµ: Φ(J) p,q(ξ) are the complex scalar fields filling the flat K ¨ahler manifold of the Wess-Zumino multiplets in the microscopic lagrangian of the corresponding gauge theory. 4.1.2 The locus V6 ⊂ SZ4 As it was explained in the context of the general framework reviewed in section 2.5, the 3 |Γ|-dimensional flat K¨ahler manifold SΓ contains always a subvariety V|Γ|+2 ⊂ SΓ of dimension |Γ|+2 which is singled out by the following set of quadratic equations: [A, B] = [B, C] = [C , A] =0 (4.1.12) From the physical point of view, the holomorphic equation (4.1.12) occurs as the vanishing of the superpotential derivatives ∂iW (Φ) = 0 while looking for the scalar potential extrema, namely for the classical vacua of the gauge theory. From the mathematical viewpoint the locus V|Γ|+2 is the one we start from in order to calculate the K¨ahler quotient Mζ which provides the crepant resolution of the singularity. At the end of the day Mζ is just the manifold of classical vacua of the gauge theory. As discussed in section 2.5, the vanishing locus (4.1.12) 82consists of several irreducible components of different dimensions, and V|Γ|+2 = V6 is the only component of dimension 6. It can be represented in the form GΓ ·LΓ, where GΓ is the holomorphic quiver group, defined in the next section, and LΓ is the three dimensional locus that we will shortly characterize. An open part of this principal component V6 can be given by the following explicit equations: Φ(2) 1,0 = Φ(1) 1,0Φ(2) 0,3 Φ(1) 0,3 , Φ(2) 2,1 = Φ(1) 2,1Φ(2) 0,3 Φ(1) 0,3 , Φ(2) 3,2 = Φ(1) 3,2Φ(2) 0,3 Φ(1) 0,3 , Φ(3) 1,3 = Φ(1) 1,0Φ(3) 0,2 Φ(1) 3,2 , Φ(3) 2,0 = Φ(1) 1,0Φ(1) 2,1Φ(3) 0,2 Φ(1) 0,3Φ(1) 3,2 , Φ(3) 3,1 = Φ(1) 2,1Φ(3) 0,2 Φ(1) 0,3 (4.1.13) 4.1.3 The holomorphic quiver group GZ4 and the gauge group FZ4 Following the general scheme outlined in [17], we see that the locus SZ4 is mapped into itself by the action of the complex quiver group: GZ4 = C⋆ ×C⋆ ×C⋆ ≃ ΛΛΛ ≡   C⋆ 0 0 0 0 C⋆ 0 0 0 0 C⋆ 0 0 0 0 C⋆   ; det ΛΛΛ = 1 (4.1.14) The gauge group of the final gauge theory is the maximal compact subgroup of GZ4 , namely: FZ4 = U(1)×U(1)×U(1) ≃ ΞΞΞ ≡   U(1) 0 0 0 0 U(1) 0 0 0 0 U(1) 0 0 0 0 U(1)   ; det ΞΞΞ = 1 (4.1.15) The explicit form of the matrices ΛΛΛ and ΞΞΞ is that appropriate to the basis where the regular representation is diagonalized. In that basis the charge assignments (representation assignments) of the scalar fields are read off from the transformation rule: A(Φ′) =ΞΞΞ−1 A(Φ)ΞΞΞ, B(Φ′) =ΞΞΞ−1 B(Φ)ΞΞΞ, C(Φ′) =ΞΞΞ−1 C(Φ)ΞΞΞ (4.1.16) Then we consider the locus LZ4 made by those triplets of matrices A,B,C that belong to SΓ and are diagonal in the natural basis of the regular representation. In the diagonal basis of the regular representation the same 83matrices A,B,C have the following form: A0 =   0 0 0 Z1 Z1 0 0 0 0 Z1 0 0 0 0 Z1 0   ; B0 =   0 0 0 Z2 Z2 0 0 0 0 Z2 0 0 0 0 Z2 0   C0 =   0 0 Z3 0 0 0 0 Z3 Z3 0 0 0 0 Z3 0 0   (4.1.17) The fields Z1,2,3 provide a set of three coordinates spanning the three-dimensional locusLZ4 . The complete locus V6 coincides with the orbit of LZ4 under the free action of GZ4 : V6 = GZ4 ·LZ4 =   ΛΛΛ−1 A0 ΛΛΛ ΛΛΛ−1 B0 ΛΛΛ ΛΛΛ−1 C0 ΛΛΛ   (4.1.18) 4.2 The moment map equations Implementing once more the general procedure outlined in section 2.5 we arrive at the moment map equations and at the final crepant resolution of the singularity in the following way. We refer the reader to section 2.5 for the general definition of the moment map µ : SΓ − →F⋆ Γ where F⋆ Γ denotes the dual (as vector spaces) of the Lie algebra FΓ of the gauge group. We recall that the preimage of the level zero moment map is the FΓ orbit of the locus LΓ: µ−1 (0) =FΓ ·LΓ. (4.2.1) Note that LΓ is actually C3, so that the image ofLΓ in the K¨ahler quotient of level zero coincides with the original singular variety C3/Γ see eqn.(2.5.25) and following lines. Next, as in section 2.5.2, we consider the following decomposition of the Lie quiver group algebra: GZ4 = FZ4 ⊕KZ4 [FZ4 , FZ4 ] ⊂ FZ4 ; [FZ4 , KZ4 ] ⊂ KZ4 ; [KZ4 , KZ4 ] ⊂ FZ4 (4.2.2) where FZ4 is the maximal compact subalgebra. A special feature of all the quiver groups and Lie algebras is that FΓ and KΓ have the same real dimension |Γ|− 1 and one can choose a basis of Hermitian generators T I such that: ∀ΦΦΦ ∈ FΓ : ΦΦΦ = i ×∑ |Γ|−1 I=1 cIT I ; cI ∈ R ∀KKK ∈ KΓ : KKK = ∑ |Γ|−1 I=1 bIT I ; bI ∈ R (4.2.3) 84Correspondingly a generic element g ∈ GZ4 can be split as follows: ∀g ∈ GZ4 : g = U H ; U ∈ FZ4 ; H ∈ exp[KZ4 ] (4.2.4) Using the above property we arrive at the following parametrization of the space V6 V6 = FZ4 ·(exp[KZ4 ]·LZ4 ) (4.2.5) where, by definition, we have set: p ∈ exp[KZ4 ]·LZ4 ⇒ p = {exp[−KKK] A0 exp[KKK], exp[−KKK] B0 exp[KKK], exp[−KKK] C0 exp[KKK]} {A0, B0, C0} ∈ LZ4 KKK ∈ KZ4 (4.2.6) In our case the three generators T I of the real subspace KZ4 have been chosen as follows: T 1 =   1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   ; T 2 =   0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 0   T 3 =   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 −1   (4.2.7) So that the relevant real group element takes the following form: exp[KKK] =   H1 0 0 0 0 H2 H1 0 0 0 0 H3 H2 0 0 0 0 1 H3   (4.2.8) where HI are, by definition, real. Relying on this, in the K¨ahler quotient we can invert the order of the operations. First we quotient the action of the compact gauge groupFZ4 and then we implement the moment map constraints. We have: V6/ /FZ4 = (exp[KZ4 ]·LZ4 )/Z4, (4.2.9) where Z4 acts on LZ4 via the action induced by that of the stabiliser ofLZ4 in FZ4 . The explicit form of the triple of matrices mentioned in eqn. (4.2.6) is easily calculated on the basis of eqs. (4.1.17) and (4.2.8) p =   A B C   ≡   exp[−KKK]A0 exp[KKK] exp[−KKK]B0 exp[KKK] exp[−KKK]C0 exp[KKK]   (4.2.10) 85The moment map is given by: µ (p) = {P1,P2,P3} PI = Tr \u0002 TI \u0000\u0002 A, A†\u0003 + \u0002 B, B†\u0003 + \u0002 C , C†\u0003\u0001\u0003 (4.2.11) Imposing the moment map constraint we find: µ−1 (ζ)/ /FZ4 = {p ∈ exp[KZ4 ]·LZ4 ∥ PI(p) =ζI}/Z4. (4.2.12) Eq. (4.2.12) provides an explicit algorithm to calculate the K ¨ahler potential of the final resolved manifold if we are able to solve the constraints for HI in terms of the triple of complex coordinates Zi (i = 1,2,3). Indeed we recall that the K ¨ahler potential KMζ of the resolved variety Mζ = Nζ /FZ4 , where Nζ = µ−1(ζ) ⊂ SΓ, is given by the general formula 2.6.32: KMζ = KNζ +ζI CIJ logH 2αζJ J (4.2.13) Here KNζ is the restriction to Nζ of the K¨ahler potential of the flat K¨ahler metric on SΓ, which is FZ4 -invariant and therefore can be regarded as a function on Mζ . The positive rational constants αζ are to be chosen so that the functions H 2αζJ J are hermitian fibre metrics on the three tautological bundles; these constants are completely determined by the geometry, but it will be easier to fix them later on, using the fact that Chern characters of the tautological line bundles are a basis of the cohomology ring of Mζ [32]. Moreover, CIJ = Tr \u0000 T I T J\u0001 =   2 −1 0 −1 2 −1 0 −1 2   (4.2.14) is the matrix of scalar products of the gauge group generators. The final outcome of this calculation was already presented in section 9 of [17]. As it was done there, it is convenient to consider the following linear combinations:   1 0 −1 1 −1 1 0 1 0     P1 −ζ1 P2 −ζ2 P3 −ζ3   = 0 (4.2.15) In this way we obtain:   −(X2 1 −X2 3 )(X1X3(∆2 1+∆2 2)+(1+X2 2 )∆2 3) X1X2X3 (X2+X3 2 −X1X3(X2 1 +X2 3 ))(∆2 1+∆2 2) X1X2X3 −(−1+X2 2 )(X2(∆2 1+∆2 2)+(X2 1 +X2 3 )∆2 3) X1X2X3   =   ζ1 −ζ3 ζ1 −ζ2 +ζ3 ζ2   (4.2.16) where ∆i =| Zi | are the moduli of the three complex coordinates Zi, and XJ = H2 J for J = 1,2,3. Applying the general framework developed in [17] we have H ≡   H1 0 0 0 H2 0 0 0 H3   (4.2.17) 86and the positive definite hermitian matrix H 2αζJ is the fibre metric on the direct sum: R = rM I=1 RI (4.2.18) of the r = 3 tautological bundles that, by construction, are holomorphic vector bundles with rank equal to the dimensions of the three nontrivial irreducible representations of Γ, which in this case is always one: RI π− →Mζ ; ∀p ∈ Mζ : π−1(p) ≈ CnI (4.2.19) The compatible connection1 on the holomorphic vector bundle R = L I RI is given by ϑ = L I ϑI, where ϑI = αζI ∂ logXI = H −2αζI ∂H 2αζI (4.2.20) which is a 1-form with values in C, the Lie algebra of the structural group C∗ of the I-th tautological vector bundle. The natural connection of the FZ4 principal bundle, mentioned in eqn. (4.1.15) is just, according to the universal scheme, the imaginary part of the connection ϑ. In order to solve the system of equations (4.2.16) it is convenient to change variables and write: Σ = ∆2 1 +∆2 2 ; U = ∆2 3 (4.2.21) In this way we obtain:    −UX 2 2 X2 1 −UX 2 1 +UX 2 2 X2 3 +UX 2 3 −ζ1X2X3X1 +ζ3X2X3X1 −ΣX3X3 1 +ΣX3 3 X1 = 0 −ζ1X2X3X1 +ζ2X2X3X1 −ζ3X2X3X1 −ΣX3X3 1 −ΣX3 3 X1 +ΣX3 2 +ΣX2 = 0 −UX 2 1 X2 2 −UX 2 3 X2 2 +UX 2 1 +UX 2 3 −ζ2X1X3X2 −ΣX3 2 +ΣX2 = 0 (4.2.22) This is the fundamental algebraic system encoding all information about the singularity resolution. 4.3 Properties of the moment map algebraic system and chamber structure The resolubility of the system (4.2.22), viewed as a set of algebraic equations of higher order has some very peculiar properties that actually encode the topology and analytic structure of the resolved manifold Y Z4 [3] and of its possible degenerations. The most relevant property of (4.2.22) is that for generic values U > 0,Σ > 0 it has always one and only one root where allXi > 0 are real positive. This is of course expected from the general theory, as we know there are a well-defined quotient, and a K¨aher metric on the quotient, for every generic choice of the level parameters ζ (these are called Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters in gauge theory, while in algebraic geometry they correspond to the so-called stability parameters); but it has also been verified numerically at an arbitrary large collection of random points ζ ∈ R3 and for an arbitrary large collection of points {U,Σ} ∈R2 +. The special surface S2. Although it is not a wall there is in the ζ space a planar surface defined by the following conditions S2 ≡ {ζ1 = ζ3 = a, ζ2 = b ̸= 2a} (4.3.1) 1Following standard mathematical nomenclature, we call compatible connection on a holomorphic vector bundle, one whose (0,1) part is the Cauchy-Riemann operator of the bundle. 87where the algebraic system (4.2.22) acquires a more manageable form without loosing generality. The strong simplification is encoded in the following condition: X1 = X2 (4.3.2) Thanks to eqn.(4.3.2), on the plane S2 the moment map system reduces to a system of two rather than three equations. To understand eqn.(4.3.2) we need to recall some general properties of the moment map equations for this special case. Considering the system (4.2.22), it can be observed that one of the three functions Xi can always be algebraically solved in terms of the other two. Indeed we can write: X3 = X1 2 s ζ2 +ζ3 \u0000 X2 2 −1 \u0001 ζ2 +ζ1 \u0000 X2 2 −1 \u0001 (4.3.3) This relation is the algebraic counterpart, in the moment map equations of the topological result that the homol- ogy and cohomology of the resolved variety Y Z4 [3] has dimension 2. If, inspired by eqn.(4.3.3) we consider the case where all parameters ζi are different from zero but two of them, namely ζ1 and ζ3 are equal among them- selves, i.e. we localize our calculations on the surfaceS2, then eqn.(4.3.2) follows, yielding a reduced system of moment map equations:   −2aX2X2 1 +bX2X2 1 −2ΣX4 1 +ΣX3 2 +ΣX2 −bX2 1 X2 −2UX 2 1 X2 2 +2UX 2 1 −ΣX3 2 +ΣX2 ! =   0 0 ! (4.3.4) 4.3.1 Generalities on the chamber structure In general, the space of parameters ζ (which are closely related to the stability parameters of the GIT quotient construction)2 has a chamber structure. Let C be a chamber in that space, and W a wall of C; denote by MC the resolution corresponding to a generic ζ in C (they are all isomorphic), and by MW the resolution corresponding to a generic ζ in W . There is a well-defined morphism γ W : MC → MW (actually one should take the normalization of the second space, but we skip such details). In general, the morphism γ W contracts curves or divisors; in [32] the walls are classified according to the nature of the contractions performed by γ W . One says that W is of 1. type 0 if γ W is an isomorphism; 2. type I if γ W contracts a curve to a point; 3. type III if γ W contracts a divisor to a curve. Walls of type II, that should contract a divisor to a point, do not actually exist, as shown in [32]. The chamber structure pertaining to our example is analyzed and reconstructed in detail in section 4.5. A guide to the localization of walls and chambers is provided by the existence of some lines in ζ space where the system (4.2.22) becomes solvable by radicals or reduces to a single algebraic equation. These lines either turn out to be edges of the convex chambers occuring at intersections of walls, or just belong to walls. We begin by analyzing such solvable lines. 2Geometric invariant theory, usually shortened into GIT, is the standard way of taking quotients in algebraic geometry. The relation between the GIT approach and the K¨ahler quotient `a la Kronheimer in the problem at hand is explored in [26]. 884.3.2 The solvable lines located in ζ space In the ζ moduli space there are few subcases where the solution of the algebraic system (4.2.22) can be reduced to finding the roots of a single algebraic equation whose order is equal or less than 6. As anticipated these solvable cases are located on walls of the chamber and in most case occur at the intersection of two walls. A) Case Cardano I, ζ1 = 0, ζ2 = ζ3 = s. With this choice the general solution of the system (4.2.22) is provided by setting the ansatz displayed below and by solving the quartic equation for X contained in the next line: X1 = 1, X2 = X, X3 = X sX2 −UX 4 +U −ΣX3 +ΣX = 0 (4.3.5) Obviously we need to choose a branch of the solution such that X is real and positive. As we discuss later on, this is always possible for all values of U and Σ and the required branch is unique. To this effect a simple, but very crucial observation is the following. The arithmetic square root p |s| of the level parameter s can be used as length scale of the considered space by rescaling the coordinates as follows: Zi → p |s| eZi so that equation (4.3.5) can be rewritten as follows −eUX 4 +U −eΣX3 +sX2 + eΣX = 0 (4.3.6) where s denotes the sign of the moment map level. This implies that we have only three cases to be studied, namely: s =    1 0 −1 (4.3.7) The second case corresponds to the original singular orbifold while the first and the third yield one in- stance of what we name the Cardano manifold. We will see that it corresponds to one of the possible degenerations of the full resolution Y Z4 [3] . In the following we disregard the tildas and we simply write: −UX 4 +U −ΣX3 ± X2 +ΣX = 0 (4.3.8) B) Case Cardano II ζ3 = 0, ζ1 = ζ2 = s. With this choice the general solution of the system (4.2.22) is provided by setting the ansatz displayed below and by solving the quartic equation for X contained in the next line: X1 = X, X2 = X, X3 = 1 −sX2 −UX 4 +U −ΣX3 +ΣX = 0 (4.3.9) As one sees eqn. (4.3.9) can be reduced to the form (4.3.8) by means of a rescaling similar to that utilized in the previous case. All previous conclusions apply to this case upon the exchange of X1 and X3. C) Case Eguchi-Hanson ζ2 = 0, ζ1 = ζ3 = s. With this choice the general solution of the system (4.2.22) is provided by setting the ansatz displayed below and by solving the quartic equation for X contained in the next line: X1 = X, X2 = 1 X3 = X −2sX2 +2Σ−2ΣX4 = 0 (4.3.10) 89The unique real positive branch of the solution to eqn. (4.3.10) is given below: X → q√ s2+4Σ2 Σ − s Σ√ 2 (4.3.11) We will see in a later section that eqn.(4.3.11) leads to a complex three-dimensional manifold that is the tensor product EH ×C, having denoted by EH the Eguchi-Hanson hyperk¨ahler manifold. D) Case Kamp ´e ζ2 = 2s, ζ1 = ζ3 = s. With this choice the general solution of the system (4.2.22) is provided by setting the ansatz displayed below and by solving the sextic equation for X contained in the next line: X1 = 4√ Z3 +Z 4√ 2 , X2 = Z, X3 = 4√ Z3 +Z 4√ 2 2 \u0000 Z2 +1 \u0001\u0000 sZ −UZ 2 +U \u00012 −Σ2Z \u0000 Z2 −1 \u00012 = 0 (4.3.12) As in other cases the root of the sextic equation must be chosen real and positive. Furthermore the absolute value of the parameter s can be disposed off by means of a rescaling. 4.3.3 The K ¨ahler potential of the quotient manifolds Before discussing the chamber structure guided by the discovery of the above mentioned solvable edgesA,B,C,D it is useful to complete the determination of the K ¨ahler manifolds singled out by such edges. This requires considering the explicit form of the K ¨ahler potential for the quotient manifolds. Following the general rules of the K ¨ahler quotient resolution `a la Kronheimer the restriction of the K ¨ahler potential of the linear space SΓ = HomΓ (R,Q⊗R) to the algebraic locus D(LΓ) and then to the level surface Nζ is, for the case under consideration, the following one: K0 |Nζ = U \u0000 X2 2 +1 \u0001\u0000 X2 1 +X2 3 \u0001 +Σ \u0000 X3 2 +X2 +X1 X3 \u0000 X2 1 +X2 3 \u0001\u0001 X1X2X3 (4.3.13) The complete K¨ahler potential of the resolved variety is given by: KMζ = K0 |Nζ +ζI CIJ log[XJ] (4.3.14) The main point we need to stress is that, depending on the choices of the moduliζI (up to rescalings) we can obtain substantially different manifolds, both topologically and metrically. The generic case which captures the entire algebraic structure of the resolved variety, to be discussed in later sections by means of toric geometry, is provided by ζ1 ̸= 0 , ζ2 ̸= 0 , ζ3 ̸= 0 (4.3.15) We name the corresponding K¨ahler manifold Y . For the solvable edges of moduli space which we have classified in the previous section we have instead the following results A) Cardano case M0,1,1. We name Cardano manifold the one emerging from the choiceζ1 = 0, ζ2 = 1, ζ3 = 1 where the solution of the moment map equations is reduced to the solution of the quartic algebraic equation (4.3.8). Choosing the sign plus in that equation and performing the substitution X1 = 1, X2 = X, X3 = X 90the K¨ahler potential of the Cardano manifold M0,1,1 takes the form: KM0,1,1 = 2 logX + \u0000 X2 +1 \u0001\u0000 U \u0000 X2 +1 \u0001 +2ΣX \u0001 X2 (4.3.16) where, depending on the Σ,U region, X is the positive real root of the quartic equation −UX 4 +U −ΣX3 +X2 +ΣX = 0 (4.3.17) We already argued that this exists and is unique in all regions of theΣ,U plane. B) Cardano case M1,1,0. This turns out to be an identical copy of the previous Cardano manifold. It emerges from the choice ζ1 = 1, ζ2 = 1, ζ3 = 0 for which the solution of the moment map equations are also reduced to the solution of the quartic algebraic equation (4.3.8). Performing the substitution X1 = X, X2 = X, X3 = 1 the K¨ahler potential of the Cardano manifold M1,1,0 takes the form: KM1,1,0 = 2 log(X)+ \u0000 X2 +1 \u0001\u0000 UX 2 +U +2ΣX \u0001 X2 (4.3.18) which is identical with eqn. (4.3.16) and X is once again the positive real root of the quartic equation (4.3.17). I do not discuss the explicit solution of the quartic equation (4.3.17) which is reported in the original paper [23]. C) Eguchi Hanson case Ms,0,s. When we choose ζ1 = s, ζ2 = 0, ζ3 = s the moment map system reduces to eqs. (4.3.10). Performing the substitution X1 = X, X2 = 1, X3 = X and using eqn. (4.3.11) the K ¨ahler potential of the manifold Ms,0,s takes the form: KMs,0,s = 4s log[X] +2ΣX2 + 2Σ X2 | {z } K2 +4U (4.3.19) What we immediately observe from eqn. (4.3.19) is that the K¨ahler potential is of the form: KMs,0,s = K2 \u0000 Z1,Z2,Z1,Z2 \u0001 | {z } K¨ahler potential of a two-fold +4 ×|Z3|2 (4.3.20) Hence the manifold Ms,0,s is a direct product: Ms,0,s = MB × C (4.3.21) It is not difficult to realize that the manifold MB is just the Eguchi-Hanson space EH ≡ ALEZ2 . To this effect it suffices to set s = ℓ 2 and rescale the coordinates Z1,2 → ˇZ1,2 2 . This implies Σ = 1 4 |ˇZ|2 and the K¨ahler potential K2 \u0000 Z1,Z2,Z1,Z2 \u0001 turns out to be K2 = q ℓ2 +|ˇZ|4 + ℓ log  −ℓ+ q ℓ2 +|ˇZ|4 |ˇZ|2   (4.3.22) which is essentially equivalent to the form of the Eguchi-Hanson K ¨ahler potential given in eqn. (7.22) of [17]. This might be already conclusive, yet for later purposes it is convenient to consider the further 91development of the result (4.3.22) since the known and fully computable case of the Eguchi-Hanson space allows us to calibrate the general formula for the K ¨ahler potential (4.2.13). To this effect recalling the topological structure of the Eguchi Hanson space that is the total space of the line bundle OP1 (−2) we perform the change of variables: ˇZ1 = u√v ; ˇZ2 = √v (4.3.23) where u is the complex coordinate of the compact baseP1, while v is the complex coordinate spanning the non-compact fibre. Upon such a change the K¨ahler potential (4.3.22) becomes: K2 = q |v|2(|u|2 +1)2 +ℓ2 + αζ ℓlog  p |v|2(|u|2 +1)2 +ℓ2 −ℓ (|u|2 +1) p |v|2 ! (4.3.24) A further important information can be extracted from the present case. Setting v = 0 we perform the reduction to the exceptional divisor of this partial resolution which is just the base manifoldP1 of Eguchi- Hanson space. The reduction of the K ¨ahler 2-form to this divisor is very simple and it is the following one: K |P1 = ρ √ ℓ2dρ ∧dθ π (ρ2 +1)2 (4.3.25) where we have set u = ρ exp[iθ]. It follows that the period integral of the K ¨ahler 2-form on the unique homology cycle C1 of the partial resolution EH ×C which is the above mentioned P1 is: Z C1 K = 2π Z ∞ 0 ρ √ ℓ2dρ π (ρ2 +1)2 = √ ℓ2 (4.3.26) Equation (4.3.26) sends us two important messages: • Whether the level parameter s = ℓ/2 is positive or negative does not matter. • The absolute value |s| encodes the size of the homology cycle in the exceptional divisor. When it vanishes the homology cycle shrinks to a point and we have a further degeneration. D) Sextic case or the Kamp´e manifold3 Ms,2s,s. When we choose ζ1 = s, ζ2 = 2s, ζ3 = s the moment map system reduces to eqs. (4.3.12). With the same positions used there, the K ¨ahler potential of the Ms,2s,s- manifold turns out to be the following one: KM1,2,1 = 2s log(Z) + √ 2 √ Z3 +Z \u0010√ 2U √ Z3 +Z +2ΣZ \u0011 Z2 (4.3.27) where the function Z(Σ,U) of the complex coordinates is the positive real root, depending on the Σ,U region of the sextic equation: 2 \u0000 Z2 +1 \u0001\u0000 sZ −UZ 2 +U \u00012 −Σ2Z \u0000 Z2 −1 \u00012 = 0 (4.3.28) In the next section we discuss the geometry of the crepant resolution of the singularityC3 Z4 utilizing toric geometry. Then we return to the formulae for the K ¨ahler potential displayed in the present section in order to see how the K¨ahler geometry of the entire space and in particular of the various components of the exceptional divisor is 3Since it is generally stated that the roots of a general sextic equation can be written in terms of Kamp´e de F´eriet functions, although explicit generic formulae are difficult to be found, we have decided to callMs,2s,s the Kamp´e manifold with the same logic that led us to name M0,s,s the Cardano manifold. 92realized in the various corners of the moduli-space. This will allow us to discuss the Chamber Structure of this particular instance of K¨ahler quotient resolution `a la Kronheimer. As we are going to see, all the four cases analyzed in the present section, the two Cardano cases, the Eguchi- Hanson case and the Kamp´e case correspond to partial resolutions of the orbifold singularity and indeed they are located on walls or even on edges where some homology cycles shrink to zero. 4.4 Toric geometry description of the crepant resolution As announced above in the present section we study the full and partial resolutions of the singularity C3/Z4 in terms of toric geometry. Both resolutions turn out to be the total space of the canonical line bundle over an algebraic surface, respectively the second Hirzebruch surface F2 and the weighted projective plane WP[1,1,2]. The main output of this study is provided by two informations: 1. The identification as algebraic varieties of the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor DE intro- duced by the resolution. 2. The explicit form of the atlas of coordinate patches that describe the resolved manifold and the coordinate transformation from the original Zi to the new u,v,w (appropriate to each patch) that constitute the blowup of the singularities. The second information of the above list and in particular the equation of the exceptional divisor in each patch is the main tool that allows to connect the K ¨ahler quotient description outlined in the previous sections with the algebraic description. In particular by this token we arrive at the determination of the K ¨ahler metric of the exceptional divisor components induced by the Kronheimer construction. The material contained in the following subsections, which is taken from the original paper [23], involves advanced concepts of algebraic geometry and might be hard to be grasped by those readers who are deprived of sufficient background knowledge in that field. These readers can skip all the details of the proofs and of the arguments and just digest the information mentioned in the above two points. The complete resolution of the singularity turns out to be the total space of the canonical bundle of the second Hirzebruch surface: Y Z4 [3] = tot(K [F2]) (4.4.1) An atlas of coordinate patches on Y Z4 [3] is provided in eqn.s((4.4.8),(4.4.9)) torically characterized in tables 4.3 and 4.4. Furthermore the partial resolution eY Z4 [3] that occurs on certain walls is the total space of the canonical bundle on the weighted projective space WP1,1,2: eY Z4 [3] = tot(K [WP1,1,2]) (4.4.2) 4.4.1 The singular variety Y Z4 0 = C3/Z4 We shall denote by (x,y,z) the coordinates of C3, by {ei} the standard basis of R3 and by {εi} the dual basis. The action of Z4 is given by (x,y,z) 7→ (ωx,ωy,ω2z) with ω4 = 1. It is easy to find a basis for the space of invariant Laurent polynomials: I1 = xy−1, I2 = y2 z−1, I3 = z2 (4.4.3) 93so that the three vectors u1 = ε1 −ε2, u2 = 2ε2 −ε3, u3 = 2ε3 generate the lattice M of invariants, which is a sublattice of the standard (dual) lattice M0. The lattice N dual to M is a superlattice of the standard lattice N0, and is generated by the vectors w1 = e1, w2 = 1 2 e1 + 1 2 e2, w3 = 1 4 e1 + 1 4 e2 + 1 2 e3. (4.4.4) The generators of the rays giving the cone associated with the variety Y Z4 0 are obtained by inverting these rela- tions, i.e., v1 = w1, v2 = 2w2 −w1, v3 = −w2 +2w3. From now on, unless differently stated, coordinate expressions will always refer to this basis {wi} of N. So the rays of the fan Σ0 of Y Z4 0 are v1 = (1,0,0), v2 = (−1,2,0), v3 = (0,−1,2) They do not form a basis of N, according to the fact that Y Z4 0 is singular (note indeed that that N/∑i Zvi = Z4). 4.4.2 The full resolution Y Z4 [3] of Y Z4 0 = C3/Z4 In this section we study the full (smooth) resolutionY Z4 [3] of the singular quotientY Z4 0 , describing its torus-invariant divisors and curves and the natural coordinate systems on its affine patches. The fan The fan of Y Z4 [3] is obtained by adding to the fan Σ0 the rays generated by the lattice points lying on the triangle with vertices {vi}. These are w2 = (0,1,0), w3 = (0,0,1). The torus invariant divisors corresponding to the two new rays of the fan are the components of the exceptional divisor. Since w3 is in the interior of the triangle, the corresponding component of the exceptional divisor is compact, while the component corresponding to w2, which lies on the border, is noncompact. Note indeed that, according to the equations (4.4.4), w2 and w3 correspond to the junior classes 1 2 (1,1,0) (noncompact) and 1 4 (1,1,2) (compact) associated with the given representation of Z4. We shall denote by Y Z4 [3] this resolution of singularities. Figure 4.2 shows the fan of Y Z4 [3] and the associated planar graph. The planar graph is obtained by projecting the generators of the rays onto the triangle formed by the three original vertices; this is shown in a 3-dimensional perspective in Figure 4.3. One can explicitly check that all cones of ΣY are smooth, so that Y Z4 [3] is indeed smooth. Note that all cones of ΣY are contained in the cones of Σ0, which corresponds to the existence of a morphism Y Z4 [3] →Y Z4 0 . If we first make the blowup corresponding to the ray w3, i.e., to the junior class 1 4 (1,1,2), according to the general theory the exceptional divisor is a copy of the weighted projective plane WP[1,1,2]. When we make the second blowup, i.e. we blow up the z axis, we also blowup WP[1,1,2] at its singular point, so that the compact component of the exceptional divisor of the resolution of Y Z4 0 is a copy of the second Hirzebruch surface F2. Moreover, the noncompact component of the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to P1 ×C (which, by the way, turns out to be the weighted projective space WP[1,1,0]). This will be shown in more detail in the next sections (in particular, the compact exceptional divisor will be characterized as the Hirzebruch surface F2 by computing its fan). 94w2 = (0,1,0) v1 = (1,0,0) v2 = (−1,2,0) v3 = (0,−1,2) w3 = (0,0,1) v1 v2 v3 w3 σ4 σ3 w2 σ2σ1 Figure 4.2: The fan ΣY of the resolution Y Z4 [3] and the associated planar graph Figure 4.3: The figure displays a finite portion of the lattice N dual to the lattice M of Z4-invariants and the generators of the cone σ describing the singular quotient C3/Z4 marked as fat dark arrows. The extremal points of the three generators single out a triangle, which intersects the lattice N in two additional points, namely the extremal points of the vector w3 and of the vector w2, marked as lighter arrows in the figure. These vectors have to be added to the fan and divide the original cone into four maximal cones, corresponding to as many open charts of the resolved smooth toric variety. By general theory [28] (see also [17]) we know h2(Y Z4 [3] ,Q) =2, h2(Y Z4 [3] ,Q) =2, h2 c(Y Z4 [3] ,Q) =1, h4(Y Z4 [3] ,Q) =1. Divisors We analyze the toric divisors ofY Z4 [3] ; they are summarized in Table 4.1. Each of these is associated with a ray of the fan ΣY . The divisors corresponding to w3, w2, v1, v3, v2 will be denoted Dc, Dnc, DEH , D4, D′ EH respectively. Since Y Z4 [3] is smooth all of them are Cartier. Table 4.1 shows the fans of these divisors and what variety they are as intrinsic varieties. The fans are depicted in Figure 4.4.4 The fan of Dc is generated by the rays v2, w2, v1, v3, which shows that Dc is the second Hirzebruch surface F2. The corresponding curves in Dc have been denoted 4In the cases when the ray associated to the divisor is not a coordinate axis we made a change of basis. 95E3 E1 E4 E2 Dc τ2 τ3 τ4 τ1 Dnc DEH , D′ EH D4 Figure 4.4: The fans of the 5 toric divisors of Y Z4 [3] . In the fan of Dc we have labelled the rays with the names of the corresponding divisors; the τi’s are the maximal cones. E1, E2, E3, E4 respectively. From the self-intersections of these curves (in Dc) E2 1 = 0, E2 2 = −2, E2 3 = 0, E2 4 = 2 we see that E2 is the section of F2 → P1 which squares to −2, i.e., the exceptional divisor of the blowup F2 → WP[1,1,2], while E4 is the section that squares to 2, and E1, E3 are the toric fibres of F2 → P1. Table 4.1: Toric Divisors inY Z4 [3] . The last column shows the components of the divisor class on the basis given by (Dnc,Dc). The variety ALEA1 is the Eguchi-Hanson space, the crepant resolution of the singular space C2/Z2. Ray Divisor Fan Variety Components w3 Dc (1,0), (−1,2), (0,−1), (0,1) F2 (0,1) w2 Dnc (1,0), (−1,0), (0,1) P1 ×C (1,0) v1 DEH (1,0), (−1,2), (0,1) ALEA1 (−1 2 ,−1 4 ) v3 D4 (1,0), (−1,4), (0,1) tot (O(−4) → P1) (0,−1 2 ) v2 D′ EH (1,0), (−1,2), (0,1) ALEA1 (−1 2 ,−1 4 ) Among the 5 divisors only 2 are independent in cohomology. We consider the exact sequence: 0 → M A− →DivT(Y Z4 [3] ) B− →Pic(Y Z4 [3] ) → 0 (4.4.5) where M is the dual lattice, DivT(Y Z4 [3] ) is the group of torus-invariant divisors, and Pic(Y Z4 [3] ) is the Picard group5 of the full resolution Y Z4 [3] . The morphism B simply takes the class of a divisor in the Picard group, while for every m ∈ M, A(m) is the divisor associated with the rational function defined by m. Moreover we know that 5The Picard group Pic (X) of a complex variety X is the group of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on X. Using ˇCech cohomology it can be represented as the cohomology group H1(X,O∗ X ), where O∗ X is the sheaf of nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions on X. 96the classes of the divisors Dnc and Dc generate Pic(Y Z4 [3] ) over Q [28]. With that choice of basis in Pic(Y Z4 [3] )⊗Q, with the basis given by the 5 divisors in DivT(Y Z4 [3] )⊗Q, and the basis in M ⊗Q given by the duals of the {wi}, the morphisms A and B are represented over the rationals by the matrices A =   1 0 0 −1 2 0 0 −1 2 0 1 0 0 0 1   , B =   −1 2 −1 2 0 1 0 −1 4 −1 4 −1 2 0 1 ! We deduce that the relations among the classes of the 5 toric divisors in the Picard group are6 [DEH ] = [D′ EH ] =−1 2 [Dnc]− 1 4 [Dc] (4.4.6) [D4] =−1 2 [Dc] (4.4.7) Since the canonical divisor can be written as minus the sum of the torus-invariant divisors, one has \u0014 KY Z4 [3] \u0015 = −[Dnc]−[Dc]−[DEH ]−[D′ EH ]−[D4] =0 consistently with the fact that the resolutionY Z4 [3] →Y Z4 0 is crepant. (Note that Pic(Y Z4 [3] ) is free over Z, so that the equality \u0014 KY Z4 [3] \u0015 = 0 in Pic(Y Z4 [3] )⊗Q also implies that \u0014 KY Z4 [3] \u0015 = 0 in Pic(Y Z4 [3] )). The matrix B can also be chosen as B =   1 1 0 −2 0 0 0 1 1 −2 ! which corresponds to taking the classes of DEH and D4 as basis of the Picard group. In this way the matrix B is integral, which means that DEH and D4 generate Pic(Y Z4 [3] ) over the integers. Toric curves and intersections The planar graph in Figure 4.2 shows that Y Z4 [3] has 4 compact toric curves, corresponding to the inner edges of the graph. The intersection between a smooth irreducible curve C and a Cartier divisor D is defined as C ·D = deg( f ∗OY (D)) where f : C → Y Z4 [3] is the embedding, and OY (D) is the line bundle associated to the divisor 7. Inspection of the fan allows one to detect when the intersection is transversal (in which case the intersection mumber is 1), empty (intersection number 0), or the curve is inside the divisor. The intersections are shown in Table 4.2. 6The notation [D] means the class in the Picard group of the line bundle OX (D). 7This also allows one to compute the intersection between a curve C and a Weil divisor D. Indeed simplicial toric varieties are Q-factorial, i.e., every Weil divisor has a multiple that is Cartier. So ifmD is Cartier, one defines C ·D = 1 m C ·(mD). This may be a rational number. 97Table 4.2: Intersections among the toric curves and divisors in the full resolution Y Z4 [3] . For the curves that are inside Dc the last two columns also show the identifications with the curves corresponding to the rays in the fan of Dc of Figure 4.4, and what they are inside the second Hirzebruch surface. Note that C1 is the intersection between the two components of the exceptional divisor. The basis of the fibration Dc → P1 may be identified with C1, while C2, C4 are the fibres over two toric points, which correspond to the cones σ1 and σ2. Edge/face Curve Dc Dnc DEH D′ EH D4 Inside Dc (w2w3) C1 0 - 2 1 1 0 E2 −2-section (v1w3) C2 -2 1 0 0 1 E3 fibre (v2w3) C4 -2 1 0 0 1 E1 fibre (v3w3) C5 -4 0 1 1 2 E4 2-section (v1w2) C3 1 0 0 0 0 The intersection numbers of DEH and D4 with C1, C2 show that the latter are a basis of H2(Y Z4 [3] ,Z) dual to {[D4],[DEH ]}. Coordinate systems and curves The four 3-dimensional cones in the fan of Y Z4 [3] correspond to four affine open varieties, and since all cones are smooth (basic), they are copies of C2. The variables attached to the rays generating a cone provide a coordinate system on the corresponding affine set. A face between two 3-dimensional cones corresponds to the intersection between the two open sets. Note that all charts have a common intersection, as they all contain the 3-dimensional torus corresponding to the origin of the fan. Table 4.3 shows the association among cones, rays, coordinates and coordinate expressions of toric curves. Below we provide a list of coordinate systems, with all transition functions between them, and the expressions of the toric curves in the coordinate systems of the charts they belong to. Table 4.4 displays the coordinate transformations among the four coordinate systems. We have denoted Ci, i = 1... 5 as before, and moreoverC6, C7, C8 are the noncompact toric curves in the charts 2, 3 and 4 (analogously, C3 was the noncompact curve in the chart 1). The column “Dual gen.” displays the generators of the dual cone. In each chart, the coordinates (u,v,w) are related to the invariants (4.4.3) as follows: {u,v,w}1 = { x y , y2 z , z2 } {u,v,w}2 = { y x , x2 z , z2 } {u,v,w}3 = { y x , z x2 , x4 } {u,v,w}4 = { x y , y4 , z y2 } (4.4.8) Eqs. (4.4.8) can be easily inverted and one obtains: Chart Xσ1 x → u√v 4√w , y → √v 4√w , z → √w Chart Xσ2 x → √v 4√w , y → u√v 4√w , z → √w Chart Xσ3 x → 4√w , y → u 4√w , z → v√w Chart Xσ4 x → u 4√v , y → 4√v , z → √vw (4.4.9) 98The irrational coordinate transformations (4.4.9) derived from the toric construction are the essential tool to relate the results of the K ¨ahler quotient construction with the geometry of the exceptional divisor as identified by the toric resolution of the singularity. The coordinates x,y,z in the above equation are to be identified with the Z1,2,3 that parameterize the locus LZ4 composed by the matrices A0,B0,C0 of eqn. (4.1.17). As we know this locus is lifted to the resolved varietyY Z4 [3] by the action of the quiver group element exp[ΦΦΦ], whose corresponding Lie algebra element ΦΦΦ satisfies the moment map equations (4.2.16). Table 4.3: For each cone the table assigns a name to the coordinates associated to the rays. The third column lists the generators of the dual cones. The ε’s here are the dual basis to the w. We also write the equations of the toric curves in these coordinates. Cone Rays Dual gen.

Here we give a toric description of this fact. The canonical bundle of F2 is the line bundle OF2 (−2H), where H is the section of F2 → P1 squaring to 2. We regard H as the toric divisor E4, see Figure 4.4. To each of the cones τi of the fan of F2 one associates a 3-dimensional cone eσi, obtaining eσ1 = Cone((0,0,1),(0,1,0),(1,0,0)) eσ2 = Cone((0,0,1),(−1,2,0),(0,1,0)) eσ3 = Cone((0,0,1),(0,−1,2),(−1,2,0)) eσ4 = Cone((0,0,1),(1,0,0),(0,−1,2)) This is the fan of Y Z4 [3] . So, tot(OF2 (−2H)) ≃Y Z4 [3] , i.e., Y Z4 [3] is the total space of the canonical bundle of F2. Thus, the canonical bundle of Y Z4 [3] is trivial. 994.4.3 The partial resolution eY Z4 [3] The full resolution Y Z4 [3] is obtained by adding two rays to the fan ofY Z4 0 = C3/Z4. If we add just one we obtain a partial resolution. Here we examine the partial resolution that will occur in correspondence of some walls of the stability parameters space. The fan We consider the toric 3-fold eY Z4 [3] whose fan Σ3 is generated by the 4 rays v1, v2, v3, w3, which is a partial resolution of Y Z4 0 . This will appear as the partial desingularization occuring at some of the walls of the ζ parameter space (space of stability conditions). The fan and the associated planar graph are shown in Figure 4.5. The cone σ1 is singular, while σ2 and σ3 are smooth, i.e., eY Z4 [3] has one singular toric point. By general theory we know that h2(eY Z4 [3] ,Q) =2, h2(eY Z4 [3] ,Q) =h2 c(eY Z4 [3] ,Q) =h4(eY Z4 [3] ,Q) =h2(eY Z4 [3] ,Q) =1. Divisors The divisors corresponding to w3, v1, v3, v2 will be denoted Dc, DEH , D′ EH , D4, respectively. They are described in Table 4.5. The corresponding fans are shown in Figure 4.6. For the variety eY Z4 [3] , which is not smooth, the Picard group in the sequence (4.4.5) must be replaced by the class group Cl(eY Z4 [3] ), however after tensoring by the rationals the two groups coincide, so that we may ignore this fact. The group Pic(eY Z4 [3] )⊗Q is generated by the class of Dc. The matrices A and B are now A =   1 0 0 −1 2 0 0 −1 2 0 0 1   , B = \u0010 −1 4 −1 4 −1 2 1 \u0011 (the order of the toric divisors is DEH , D′ EH , D4, Dc). The relations we get among the divisor classes are [DEH ] = [D′ EH ] =−1 4 [Dc], [D4] =−1 2 [Dc]. Again, this implies \u0014 KeY Z4 [3] \u0015 = 0. The integral generator of Pic(eY Z4 [3] ) is D4. DEH and D′ EH are linearly equivalent, and both generate the class group.

The intersection numbers of the curves with the 4 toric divisors are shown in Table 4.6. The curvesC1, C2, C4 are the 3 compact curves. C3 is a noncompact curve. The class group The class group enters the exact sequence 0 → M A− →DivT(eY Z4 [3] ) → Cl(eY Z4 [3] ) → 0. So the problem is that of computing the quotient of two free abelian groups; it may have torsion. The matrixA can be put into a normal form called the Smith normal form [55]. This is diagonal, and the diagonal entries determine the class group: a diagonal block equal to the identity corresponds to a free summand of the appropriate rank, and if a value m appears, there is a summand Zm. For eY Z4 [3] the Smith normal form of the matrix A is the identity matrix, so that the quotient is Z, i.e., Cl(eY Z4 [3] ) =Z. 101Table 4.6: Intersections among the toric curves and divisors ineY Z4 [3] . The toric curves are images of curves in Y Z4 [3] via the natural map Y Z4 [3] → eY Z4 [3] , and we have used the same notation for a curve inY Z4 [3] and its image in eY Z4 [3] . The curve C8 is singular (it is actually the only singular curve among the 6 toric curves ofeY Z4 [3] ). Note that C8 is indeed the strict transform of the z axis, whose points have nontrivial isotropy, and eY Z4 [3] does not resolve this singularity as Dnc has been shrunk onto C8. The curve C1 of Y Z4 [3] has shrunk to a point. This can be explicitly checked by noting that the period of the K¨ahler form on C1 goes to zero under the blow-down morphism Y Z4 [3] → eY Z4 [3] . Face Curve Dc DEH D′ EH D4 (v1w3) C2 −2 1 2 1 2 1 (v2w3) C4 −2 1 2 1 2 1 (v1v2) C8 1 0 (v3w3) C5 −4 1 1 2 Comparing with Table 4.5 we see that the morphism Pic (eY Z4 [3] ) → Cl(eY Z4 [3] ) is the multiplication by 2 (indeed, 2[D′ EH ] = [D4]). eY Z4 [3] as a line bundle over WP[1,1,2] Also eY Z4 [3] is the total space of a line bundle, in this case overWP[1,1,2]. The fan of WP[1,1,2] is depicted on the left in Figure 4.6; it is generated by the vectors (1,0), (−1,2), (0,−1), corresponding respectively to the divisors D1, D2, D3. The divisors D1 and D2 are Weil, while D3 is Cartier. In the class group, which is Z, they are related by [D3] =2[D2] =2[D1]. Each of D1 and D2 generates the class group, and D3 generates the Picard group. We study the line bundle OWP[1,1,2] (−2D3) =OWP[1,1,2] (−4). By applying the algorithm in [56, §7.3] we see that its fan is that of eY Z4 [3] , i.e., eY Z4 [3] = tot(OWP[1,1,2] (−4)). Again, since −2D3 is a canonical divisor of eY Z4 [3] , KeY Z4 [3] is trivial. Again the toric divisors of eY Z4 [3] may be obtained from this description: DEH and D′ EH are the inverse images of D1 and D2, while D4 is the inverse image of D3; since D3 · D3 = 2, then D4 is the total space of O(−4) on P1. Moreover, Dc is the image of the zero section. Note that eY Z4 [3] is obtained by shrinking Dnc to a P1; actually Dnc is the total space of the trivial line bundle on the divisor E in F2, and WP[1,1,2] is indeed obtained by shrinking that divisor to a point. Using the generalized Kronheimer construction can calculate the K¨ahler potential, K¨ahler metric and K¨ahler form of eY Z4 [3] , verifying that the base of the bundle is indeed singular, as the periods of the K ¨ahler form on the cycle C1 vanish. This means that C1 shrinks to a point, and since C1 inside the compact exceptional divisor F2 is the exceptional divisor of the blow-down F2 → P[1,1,2], the base variety becomes singular. 4.5 Chamber Structure and the tautological bundles We can now compare the analytical results obtained from the K ¨ahler quotient `a la Kronheimer with the general predictions of the resolution of the singularity provided by toric geometry. This provides a concrete example of how the chamber structure of the ζ parameter space controls the topology of the resolutions of the singularity 102Figure 4.7: The structure of the stability chambers. The space R3 where the moment map equations always admit real nonnegative solutions is divided in two halves by the presence of a wall of type 0, named W0 which is defined by the equation ζ2 = 0 and is marked in the figure as a cyan transparent surface without meshing. In addition there are other three walls, respectively described byW1 ⇔ ζ = {x+y,x,y}, W2 ⇔ ζ = {x,x+y,y} and W3 ⇔ ζ = {x,y,x +y}, where x,y ∈ R. The planes W1,3 are of type 0, while W2 is of type 1. These three infinite planes provide the partition ofR3 into eight disjoint chambers that are described in the main text. The three planes W1,2,3 are marked in the figure as meshed surfaces of three different colors. On the three intersections of two of these planes we find the already discussed lines where the moment map equations can be solved by radicals, corresponding to the Eguchi-Hanson degeneration YEH ×C (blue line) and to the two Cardano degenerations (red lines). [32]. In the following we evaluate the periods of the differential forms arising from the Kronheimer construction on the cycles given by the curves C1, C2 that both are contained in Dc, namely in the compact component of the exceptional divisor (actually we are pulling back the differential forms from Ma,b,c to Y via the relevant con- traction morphism γ : Y → Ma,b,c, and we use the fact that the pullback is injective in cohomology. We succeed evaluating the differential form periods on the considered curves by restricting the moment map equations to the relevant exceptional divisor Dc and then to its relevant sub-loci. According to the results presented in section 4.1 for the Kronheimer construction applied to C3/Z4, there are three tautological bundles; their first Chern classes are encoded in the triple of (1,1)-forms: ω(1,1) I = i 2π ∂ ∂ log \u0002 XI\u0003 (4.5.1) 4.5.1 The stability chambers The result of the various calculations subsequently presented singles out the structure of the stability chambers which is summarized in figs. 4.7 and 4.8. Let us illustrate this structure in detail. Understanding the geometry of these pictures is a very useful guide through the subsequent computations. The original data from which we start are the following ones. To begin with we know that the entire ζ space is just R3. In figs. 4.7 and 4.8 we have drawn 3 lines. These lines correspond to the following 4 instances of degenerate spaces where the algebraic system of the moment map equations becomes solvable or partially solvable: 1) Eguchi-Hanson case ζ1 = s ; ζ2 = 0 ; ζ3 = s (4.5.2) 103Figure 4.8: In fig.4.7 we displayed only the walls defining the chamber structure. In the present picture besides the walls we show also one of the eight chambers, namely Chamber 1. It is marked as a transparent greenish-blue colored portion of three dimensional space. It is a convex cone delimited by the aforementioned walls. In pictures 4.7, 4.8 this line is fat and drawn in blue color: 2) Cardano 1 ζ1 = s ; ζ2 = s ; ζ3 = 0 (4.5.3) In pictures 4.7, 4.8 this line is solid fat and drawn in red color. We remind the reader that the name Cardano is due to the fact that the solution of the entire moment map equation system reduces to the solution of a single algebraic equation of the fourth order (see eqn. (4.3.6)). 3) Cardano 2 ζ1 = 0 ; ζ2 = s ; ζ3 = s (4.5.4) In pictures 4.7, 4.8 this line is solid fat and drawn in red color. In addition we have a 4th line that we have not drawn in fig. 4.7 and 4.8. This line entirely lies on one of the walls to be described below. 4) Kamp´e ζ1 = s ; ζ2 = 2s ; ζ3 = s (4.5.5) In fig. 4.9 this line is dashed fat and drawn in black color. We remind again the reader that the manifold was named Kamp ´e because the solution of the moment map equations reduces to finding the roots of a single algebraic equation of the sixth order. In all these cases s is a nonzero real number. Since the exceptional solvable cases must lie on some walls we have tried to conjecture which planar cones might partition the infinite cube into chambers so that the exceptional lines could lie on such planar cones and possibly be edges at some of their intersections. With some ingenuity 104Figure 4.9: This picture shows the type I plane W2. The two Cardano manifolds (red lines) and the Kamp ´e manifold (dashed black line) lay all in this plane, whose generic point corresponds, as we are going to see, to the degeneration Y3. The Eguchi-Hanson degeneration (blue line) is instead out of this plane and intersects it only in the origin. Figure 4.10: The partition of R3 into 8 convex cones. In the picture, out of the eight regions, we show only four, marking them in different transparent colors. 105we introduced the following four planar walls (here x,y are real parameters) W1 : {x +y,x,y} (4.5.6) W2 : {x,x +y,y} (4.5.7) W3 : {x,y,x +y} (4.5.8) W0 : {x,0,y} (4.5.9) that were depicted in fig. 4.7, 4.8 and split the space R3 into eight convex three–dimensional cones. The list of the eight convex cones that provide as many stability chambers is obtained through the following argument. The three planes W1,2,3 are respectively orthogonal to the following three vectors: nnn1 = {−1,1,1} (4.5.10) nnn2 = {1,−1,1} (4.5.11) nnn3 = {1,1,−1}. (4.5.12) The eight convex regions are defined by choosing the signs of the projections nnn1,2,3 ·ζ in all possible ways. In this way we obtain: Chamber I ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 > 0} Chamber II ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 < 0} Chamber III ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 > 0} (4.5.13) Chamber IV ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 > 0} Chamber V ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 > 0} Chamber VI ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 < 0} Chamber VII ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 > 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 < 0} Chamber VIII ≡ {ζ1 − ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 + ζ2 − ζ3 < 0 , −ζ1 − ζ2 + ζ3 < 0} (4.5.14) Four of the above eight chambers are displayed in fig. 4.10. 4.5.2 Edges The special solvable cases that we have found all sit at the intersection of two of the three walls W1,2,3. In particular the Cardano manifolds are edges at the intersection of the following walls: Cardano 1 = W1 \\ W2 ; Cardano 2 = W2 \\ W3 (4.5.15) while the Eguchi-Hanson case is the intersection: YEH = W1 \\ W3 (4.5.16) Note also that this edge lays entirely on the wall W0. From this point of view the Eguchi-Hanson case is similar to the Kamp ´e case, that lays entirely on the wall W2. The difference however is that, as we advocate below, the wall W0 is of type 0 while W2 is of type 1. In the first case the Eguchi-Hanson line is the only degeneracy pertaining to the wall W0, while in the second case the Kamp ´e line yields an instance of the degeneracy eY Z4 [3] as any other point of the same wall. Actually also the Cardano cases that lay on the same wall correspond to a different realization of eY Z4 [3] . 106Chamber 1 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 1 1 1 Chamber 2 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 1 1 1 Chamber 3 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −1 0 Chamber 4 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 1 1 1 Chamber 5 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −1 0 Chamber 6 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 −1 −1 −1 Chamber 7 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −1 0 Chamber 8 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −1 0 Table 4.7: The periods of the tautological bundle first Chern classes on the basis of homological cycles calculated in the interior points of all the chambers. 4.6 Periods of the Chern classes of the tautological bundles The most appropriate instrument to verify the degeneracy/non-degeneracy of the singularity resolutions provided by the K¨ahler quotient with given ζ parameters is provided by the calculation of the period matrix: ΠΠΠ ≡ Πi,J = Z Ci ωJ ; i = (1,2), J = (1,2,3) (4.6.1) 107Wall W0 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 3 0 3 C2 2 0 −2 Wall W1 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −2 0 Wall W2 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 0 0 0 C2 1 4 1 Wall W3 cycle R ω1 R ω2 R ω3 C1 1 0 1 C2 0 −2 0 Table 4.8: The periods of the tautological bundle first Chern Classes on the basis of homological cycles calculated on the 4 walls.

In particular the combination: VolVolVoli = ζI CIJ Z Ci ωJ = i 2π ζI CIJ Z Ci ∂∂ log(XJ)αζ = Z Ci Kζ (4.6.2) 108is the volume of the cycle Ci in the resolution identified by the level parameters ζ, having denoted by Kζ the corresponding K¨ahler 2-form.8 If the volume of the two homology cycles yielding the homology basis is nonzero there is no degeneration. Instead in case of degenerations at least one of such volumes vanishes. This is precisely what happens on the walls of type III, while in the interior of all chambers no degeneration appears. By means of detailed calculations the authors of [23] succeeded in calculating the periods of the first Chern forms ω(1,1) 1,2,3 on the basis of homology cycles C1,2 both for the interior points of all the chambers and for all the walls. As far as the interior chamber case is concerned such results are summarized in Table 4.7. For the walls the results are instead summarized in Table 4.8, while for the edges they are given in Table 4.9. Let us discuss the results in Table 4.7. The three leftmost columns display the degrees of the tautological line bundles RI restricted to the curves C1, C2; as the classes of the latter provide a basis of H2(Y,Z), these numbers give the first Chern classes of the line bundles over the integral basis of the Picard group Pic (Y ) given by the divisors DEH , D4, dual to the previously mentioned basis of H2(Y,Z). Note that the three columns correspond to the compact junior conjugacy class, the noncompact junior class, and the senior class respectively, and the Poincar´e duality between H2 c (Y ) and H4(Y ) explains why in all chambers R1 and R3 have the same Chern classes, and are therefore isomorphic. We know from the McKay correspondence that the cohomology of Y Z4 [3] is generated by algebraic classes which are in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements ofZ4. One issue is how these classes are expressible in terms of the Chern characters of the tautological bundles. In general, this correspondence is highly nontrivial and is governed by a complicated combinatorics. This is indeed exemplified by the quoted calculations. 8Let us remark that in agreement with eqn. (4.3.14) the contribution ∂∂K0 to the K ¨ahler 2-form is an exact form, whose integral on homology cycles therefore vanishes. Hence the volume of the homology cycles is provided by the linear combination of periods specified in eqn. (4.6.2). We also remark that, as the volume of a nonzero cycle is always positive, this is consistent with the positivity of the so-called Hodge line bundle ⊗3 J=1LΘ(DJ ) J . 109Chapter 5 The issue of Ricci-flat metric and the AMSY action/angle formalism The present chapter is devoted to the issue of the Ricci-flat metric on the resolved varietyY Γ [3]. As we know from previous discussions the HKLR metric obtained from the K¨ahler quotient `a la Kronheimer is not Ricci flat in the complex three dimensional case as it happens to be in the complex two-dimensional one. The reason while it is Ricci flat in the lower dimensional case is that there we perform a hyperK ¨ahler quotient and all hyperK ¨ahler metrics are Ricci flat by construction. In the higher dimensional case, that is purely K ¨ahler, this facilitation is lost. Hence, in order to find the Ricci flat metric onY Γ [3], which is necessary to derive the classical D3 supergravity solution, one has to work much harder. The issue was very easily solved for the case Y Z3 [3] = OP2 (−3) in chapter 3, but this is rather exceptional and due to the very high degree of homogeneity of the exceptional compact divisor that is a coset manifold for such a choice ofΓ. The next case discussed in chapter 4 is already much more difficult. The several efforts attempted at the solution of this problem were discussed in [24]. In that context the Ricci flat metric was found for the partial resolution case eY Z4 [3] = tot \u0002 K \u0000 WP[1,1,2] \u0001\u0003 as an exact solution of the relevant Monge Amp`ere equation but not for the full resolution Y Z4 [3] = tot[K (F2)]. For the second case it was only shown that the Monge Amp `ere equation can be iteratively solved in power series of the fibre coordinate but no systematic for the n-th order functional coefficient was found. Notwithstanding such failure the main positive result following from the investigations of [24] consists in the following. It became clear that the best approach to any problem concerning the study of K ¨ahler metrics on such manifolds as those emerging in the context of Kronheimer constructions is provided by the AMSY symplectic formalism [57, 58, 59] that uses real action/angle variables. Recasting the problem in that language it appeared that the Kronheimer induced metrics on the compact exceptional divisors of both Y Γ [3] and eY Z4 [3] , namely F2 and WP[1,1,2] are just members of a larger family of metrics defined by a single function of one variable that are all of co-homogeneity one. Such family includes other interesting members: in particular the entire family of so named Calabi extremal metrics which on its turn includes a subfamily of K¨ahler Einstein metrics. For the case of the latter ones the Ricci flat metric on the total space of the canonical bundle of their corresponding manifold was constructed in [25]. Such manifolds display a conical singularity but provide a very interesting alternative explicit example for case-study. Indeed taking this different viewpoint a lot of new questions emerged that are still unanswered and will be addressed in chapter 6. Indeed the reversed approach has been brought to attention: given a metric on a line bundle L(MB) where MB is a compact K ¨ahler manifold in real dimension 4 how can we explore the possibility that L(MB) =Y Γ [3] is the crepant resolution of an orbifold singularity Y Γ [3] → C3 Γ where Γ is a suitable finite subgroup of SU(3)? In the present chapter I try to report the above tale in some detail. 1105.1 Reduction of the moment map equations to the exceptional divisor and the double fibration We recall that the moment map equations for the case C3/Z4 take the following final form   −(X2 1 −X2 3 )(U(X2 2 +1)+ΣX1X3) X1X2X3 Σ(X3 2 +X2−X1X3(X2 1 +X2 3 )) X1X2X3 −(X2 2 −1)(U(X2 1 +X2 3 )+ΣX2) X1X2X3   =   ζ3 −ζ1 −ζ1 +ζ2 −ζ3 −ζ2   (5.1.1) where in terms of the complex coordinates u,v,w of the Y Z4 [3] three-fold in the first of the four dense open charts displayed in table 4.31 we have: Σ = 4 q | w |2 q (| u |2 +1)2 | v |2 ; U = q | w |2 (5.1.2) Furthermore the HKLR K¨ahler potential of the resolved variety is as follows: KHKLR =K0 + ζICIJ log(XJ) K0 = U \u0000 X2 2 +1 \u0001\u0000 X2 1 +X2 3 \u0001 +Σ \u0000 X3 2 +X2 +X1X3 \u0000 X2 1 +X2 3 \u0001\u0001 X1X2X3 (5.1.3) In a generic point of any chamber, away from the degeneration walls, the varietyY Z4 [3] is always the total space of the canonical bundle of F2 i.e. the second Hirzebruch surface. Generically, including the walls and the edges we have: Y Z4 [3] ∼ M6 = tot(K [MB]) (5.1.4) where the notation M6 emphasizes that, at the end of the day, we are concerned with a 6-dimensional real differentiable manifold equipped with a K ¨ahler metric which is not necessarily derived in terms of complex coordinates and characterized in terms of algebraic geometry: indeed we plan to resort to the AMSY action/angle formalism, to be presented here in later sections, that has many distinctive advantages and can cover a larger set of possibilities to be interpreted in the language of algebraic geometry at a subsequent stage. Similarly the 4- dimensional manifold MB mentioned in eqn. (5.1.4) that is typically the base manifold of a line-bundle, here the canonical bundle, is also a K ¨ahler manifold, possibly a singular one, whose description will be provided in the more versatile AMSY action/angle formalism. For instance on the walls of the chamber for the C3/Z4 case we have: MB = WP112. A slightly more general framework that can be extracted from the example at hand of the resolutionM6 − → C3/Z4 is encoded in the following double fibration structure: M6 π1 − →MB π2 − →P1 ∼ S2 (5.1.5) Referring to the coordinates u,v,w mentioned in (5.1.2) u,v are the complex coordinates of the base manifold MB while w is the coordinate along the fibres of the canonical bundle. The base manifold has, on its turn, the structure of a fibre bundle with base manifold a 2-sphere. The standard fibre of the base manifold MB is a second 2-sphere in the smooth case ( MB = F2) while it can be a singular variety possibly homeomorphic, yet not diffeomorphic to a 2-sphere in degenerate cases of the resolutionM6 − →C3/Z4 or in other cases that cannot be retrieved from the resolution of C3/Z4, yet adhere to the same double fibration scheme of eqn. (5.1.5). This 1The dense open chart σσσ1 is the standard one that I systematically utilize throughout these lecture notes 111is for instance the case of the singular K¨ahler Einstein manifolds MKE 4 discussed later on in these lectures. ∀p ∈ MB : π−1 1 (p) ≃ C ; ∀q ∈ S2 : π−1 2 (q) ≃    S2 if MB = F2 F ∼|{z} homeomorphic S2 if MB = MKE B F ≃ ? if MB = other cases (5.1.6) A conceptual picture of the geometric structure encoded in eqn.s (5.1.5),(5.1.6) is displayed in fig.5.1. Figure 5.1: A conceptual picture of the resolved three-fold M6 displaying its double fibration structure. The orange sphere in the middle symbolizes the base manifold of the bundleMB. A dense complex coordinate patch for this P1 is named u in the main body of these lectures. The blueish spheres around the orange one symbolize the P1 fibres of MB that can be degenerate and display conical singularities. A dense complex coordinate patch for these fibres is named v in the main body of the lectures. Finally the greenish rays enveloping the base manifold MB symbolize the noncompact fibres of the bundle M6. A dense coordinate patch for these fibres is named w in the main body of the lectures. 5.1.1 Explicit reduction of the moment map equations to MB Introducing the definitions: ϖ ≡ \u0000 1+ | u |2\u00012 | v |2 ; λ ≡ p | w | ; σ ≡| v | ; δ ≡ √ϖ σ (5.1.7) we obtain Σ → λ √ ϖ ; U → λ2 (5.1.8) that can be substituted into the moment map equations (5.1.1). These latter can be reduced by means of a limiting procedure λ → 0 to the base manifold MB by introducing suitable rescalings that were determined in [23] and 112further studied in [24, 25]: X1 → T1 r λ σ , X2 → λ2T2 , X3 → T3 r λ σ (5.1.9) Performing the substitutions (5.1.8),(5.1.9) in equations (5.1.1) and implementing the limit λ → 0 one gets the final result of a new system of algebraic equations for the moment maps T1,2,3:   T1 \u0000 (ζ3 −ζ1)σT2T3 +T 3 3 √ϖ \u0001 −σT 2 1 +σT 2 3 +T3T 3 1 \u0000 −√ϖ \u0001 σT2 \u0000 σ√ϖ −(ζ1 −ζ2 +ζ3)T1T3 \u0001 −T1T3 \u0000 T 2 1 +T 2 3 \u0001√ϖ σ \u0000 −ζ2T2T3T1 +σT2 √ϖ +T 2 1 +T 2 3 \u0001   =   0 0 0   (5.1.10) while the K¨ahler potential of eqn.(5.1.3) in the same limitλ → 0 reduces to an expression for the K¨ahler potential of the metric on the MB base manifold: K4 = σT 2 1 +σ \u0000 σT2 √ϖ +T 2 3 \u0001 +T3T 3 1 √ϖ +T 3 3 T1 √ϖ σT1T2T3 +(2ζ1 −ζ2)log(T1)+( −ζ1 +2ζ2 −ζ3)log(T2)+( 2ζ3 −ζ2)log(T3) (5.1.11) Solution of the reduced moment map equations The moment map equations (5.1.10) are three for three unknowns T1,2,3 in terms of two variables σ,ϖ. There must be a functional relation for one moment map in terms of the other two. In the 6-dimensional case such a relation is unique and reduces on the 4-dimensional manifold to the following one: T3 = s ζ3 −ζ2 ζ1 −ζ2 T1 (5.1.12) Focusing on the Weyl chamber VI as defined in (4.5.13),(4.5.14), the branch of the solution to the moment map equations (5.1.10) that is positive for all the function T1,2,3 is given below: T1 = vuut σ \u0010√ (−ζ1+ζ2−ζ3+ϖ)2+4ζ2ϖ−ζ1+ζ2−ζ3+ϖ \u0011 ζ2 r (ζ2−ζ3)ϖ ζ2−ζ1 √ 2 T2 = q ζ3−ζ2 ζ1−ζ2 \u0010p (−ζ1 +ζ2 −ζ3 +ϖ)2 +4ζ2ϖ −ζ1 +3ζ2 −ζ3 +ϖ \u0011 2ζ2 (ζ2 −ζ3) T3 = s ζ3 −ζ2 ζ1 −ζ2 T1 (5.1.13) Choice of a convenient line in the Weyl chamber VI In view of the solution (5.1.13) and of the constraint (5.1.12) a convenient choice that in no ways diminishes the generality of the result is the following one: ζ1 = ζ3 = s > 0 ; ζ2 = s(2 +α) ; α > 0 (5.1.14) where s is a dimensionful parameter that we can always reabsorb into a rescaling of the coordinates while α is a dimensionless positive real number that parameterizes a line in the VIth Weyl chamber orthogonal to the 113wall W3. For α = 0 we are on the wall and we get the partial resolution M6 = tot[K (WP112)] while for α > 0 we have M6 = tot[K (F2)]. It follows that the corresponding solutions of the reduced moment maps (5.1.13), upon insertion into eqn. (5.1.11), produce the K ¨ahler potential of a K¨ahler metric defined either on F2, or in the limiting case α = 0 on WP112. On the chosen line the solution of the moment map equations (5.1.13) reduces to: T3 = T1 = √σ r√ α2+6αϖ +ϖ(ϖ+8)+α+ϖ (α+2)√ϖ √ 2 T2 = √ α2 +6αϖ +ϖ2 +8ϖ +3α +ϖ +4 2α2 +6α +4 (5.1.15) Correspondingly the K¨ahler potential in eqn.(5.1.11) becomes K (ϖ) = 1 2 \u0012q α2 +6αϖ +ϖ(ϖ +8)+ 3α −ϖ +4 \u0013 +2(α +1)log  √ α2 +6αϖ +ϖ2 +8ϖ +3α +ϖ +4 2α2 +6α +4 ! −2α log   r√ α2+6αϖ +ϖ(ϖ+8)+α+ϖ (α+2)√ϖ √ 2   (5.1.16) Notice that dependence on the variable σ has disappeared in the final formula (5.1.16). In the algebraic part of the K¨ahler potential (first line of eqn.(5.1.11)) there is an exact cancellation between numerator and denomina- tor. In the second logarithmic part of the K ¨ahler potential this happens because log [σ] =log[v] +log[v] is the real part of a holomorphic function which does not affect the metric and simply corresponds to a K ¨ahler gauge transformation. The ultimate outcome is that the K ¨ahler metric induced on the base manifold MB by the Kron- heimer construction is encoded into a K¨ahler potential K (ϖ) that depends only on the coordinate combination ϖ defined in eqn. ((5.1.7)). This has to do with the isometries of the resulting metric which, as I explain in the next section, is always SU(2)×U(1) and defines a differentiable manifold of cohomogeneity one. 5.2 The AMSY symplectic action/angle formalism Following the discussions and elaborations of [24] based on [57, 58, 59], given the K ¨ahler potential of a toric complex n-dimensional K¨ahler manifold K (|z1|,.., |zn|), where zi = exi+iΘi are the complex coordinates, intro- ducing the moment variables µi = ∂xi K (5.2.1) we can obtain the so named symplectic potential by means of the following Legendre transform: G(µi) = n ∑ i xi µi − K (|z1|,.., |zn|) (5.2.2) where one assumes that K only depends on the modules of the z coordinates to achieve U(1)n invariance. The main issue involved in the use of eqn. (5.2.2) is the inversion transformation that expresses the coordinates xi in terms of the moments µi. Once this is done one can calculate the metric in moment variables utilizing the 114Hessian: Gi j = ∂2 ∂ µi∂ µj G(µ) (5.2.3) and its matrix inverse. Call the n angles by Θi. Complex coordinates better adapted to the complex structure tensor can be defined as ui = ezi = exp[xi + iΘi] (5.2.4) The K¨ahler 2-form has the following universal structure: K = n ∑ i=1 dµi ∧dΘi (5.2.5) and the metric is expressed as ds2 symp = Gi jdµi dµ j + G−1 i j dΘi dΘj (5.2.6) In the more recent papers pertaining to the overall research project that the present lectures aim at reviewing, strategic use of this formalism has been made both in the 4-dimensional case of the base-manifold MB and in the 6-dimensional case of the total bundle manifold M6. 5.3 K ¨ahler metrics with SU(2)×U(1) isometry Inspired by the results of the reduction to the exceptional divisor of the moment map equations encoded in eqn. (5.1.16) we are interested, to begin with, in K¨ahler metrics in two complex dimensions,n = 2, where the complex coordinates u,v enter the K¨ahler potential K0(ϖ) only through the real combinationϖ mentioned in eqn.(5.1.7). This restriction guarantees invariance of the corresponding metric under SU(2)×U(1) transformations realized as if g =   a b c d ! ∈ SU(2) then g(u,v) = \u0010 au+b cu+d , v (cu +d)2 \u0011 ; if g = exp(iθ1) ∈ U(1) then g(u,v) = (u, exp(iθ1)v). (5.3.1) The above realization of the isometry captures the idea that, at least locally, the manifold is an S2 fibration over S2 (u being a coordinate on the base and v a fibre coordinate), although their global topology might be different and have some kind of singularities. Two cases are of particular interest within such a framework, namely a) the singular weighted projective plane WP[1,1,2]; b) the second Hirzebruch surface F2. In the case of the singular varietyWP[1,1,2] we have a non K¨ahler–Einstein metric that emerges from a partial res- olution of the C3/Z4 singularity within the generalized Kronheimer construction (see [23],[24]) whose explicit K¨ahler potential is the case α = 0 in eqn. (5.1.16). On the other hand the K ¨ahler potential of the Kronheimer induced metric on F2 corresponds to the case α > 0 in the same equation. 5.3.1 A family of 4D K ¨ahler metrics Having mentioned the origin of the idea, now, using the AMSY approach, we discuss in more general terms a class of real 4D K ¨ahler manifolds, that we call MB and were studied in [25]. These are endowed with a metric invariant under the SU(2)×U(1) isometry group acting as in eqn. (5.3.1). As we already said the class of these manifolds is singled out by the above assumption that, in the complex formalism, their K ¨ahler potential K0(ϖ) 115is a function only of the invariant ϖ. The explicit form of the K ¨ahler potential K0(ϖ) cannot be worked out analytically in all cases since the inverse Legendre transform involves the roots of higher order algebraic equa- tions; yet, using the ϖ-dependence assumption, the K¨ahler metric can be explicitly worked out in the symplectic coordinates and has a simple and very elegant form – actually the metric depends on a single function of one variable FK (v) which encodes all the geometric properties and substitutes K0(ϖ). Posing all the questions in this symplectic language allows one to calculate all the geometric properties of the spaces in the class under consideration and leads also to new results and to a more systematic overview of the already known cases. We choose to treat the matter in general, by utilizing a local approach where we discuss the differential equations in a given open dense coordinate patch u,v, and we address the question of its global topological and algebraic structure only a posteriori, once the metric as been found in the considered chart, just as one typically does in General Relativity. The symplectic structure of the metric on MB is exhibited in the following way: ds2 MB = gMB|µν dqµ dqν ; qµ = {u,v,φ,τ} ; gMB =   GMB 02×2 02×2 G−1 MB ! (5.3.2) where the Hessian GMB is defined by: GMB = ∂µi ∂µ j GMB ; µi = {u,v} (5.3.3) and GMB = G0(u,v) +D(v) (5.3.4) G0 (u,v) = \u0010 v− u 2 \u0011 log(2v−u)+ 1 2ulog(u)− 1 2vlog(v) (5.3.5) The specific structure (5.3.4),(5.3.5) is the counterpart within the symplectic formalism, via Legendre transform, of the assumption that the K¨ahler potential K0(ϖ) depends only on the ϖ variable. After noting this important point, we go back to the discussion ofMB geometry and stress that with the given isometries its Riemannian structure is completely encoded in the boundary functionD(v). All the other items in the construction are as follows. For the K¨ahler form we have KMB = 2 (du∧dφ +dv∧dτ) =KMB µν dqµ ∧dqν ; KMB =   02×2 12×2 −12×2 02×2 ! (5.3.6) and for the complex structure we obtain JMB = KMB g−1 MB =   02×2 GMB −G−1 MB 02×2 ! (5.3.7) Explicitly the 2 ×2 Hessian is the following: GMB =   − v u2−2uv 1 u−2v 1 u−2v −2v(u−2v)D′′(v)+u+2v 2v(2v−u) ! G−1 MB =   u(−2v(u−2v)D′′(v)+u+2v) v(2vD′′(v)+1) 2u 2vD′′(v)+1 2u 2vD′′(v)+1 2v 2vD′′(v)+1   (5.3.8) 116The family of metrics (5.3.2) is parameterized by the choice of a unique one-variable function: f (v) ≡ D′′(v) (5.3.9) and is worth being considered in its own right. The explicit form of such metrics is the following one: ds2 MB = dv2 FK (v) + FK (v)[dφ(1 −cosθ)+ dτ]2 + v \u0000 dφ2 sin2 θ +dθ2\u0001 | {z } S2 metric (5.3.10) where we have defined FK (v) = 2v 2vD′′(v)+ 1 (5.3.11) The expression (5.3.10) for the metric is obtained performing the following convenient change of variables: u → (1 −cosθ) v ; θ ∈ [0,π] (5.3.12) which automatically takes into account that u ≤ 2v. 5.3.2 The inverse Legendre transform Before proceeding further with the analysis of the class of metrics (5.3.10), it is convenient to consider the inverse Legendre transform and see how one reconstructs the K ¨ahler potential on MB. The inverse Legendre transform provides the K¨ahler potential through the formula: K0 = xu u + xv v − GMB (u,v) (5.3.13) where GMB (u,v) is the base manifold symplectic potential defined in eqn. (5.3.4), and xu = ∂u GMB (u,v) ; xv = ∂v GMB (u,v) (5.3.14) which explicitly yields: xu = 1 2 (log(u)−log(2v−u)) ; xv = D′ (v)+ log(2v−u)− 1 2 log(v)+ 1 2 (5.3.15) Using eqn. (5.3.15)) in eqn. (5.3.13) we immediately obtain the explicit form of the base-manifold K ¨ahler po- tential as a function of the moment v: K0 = K0 (v) =v \u0012 D′ (v)+ 1 2 \u0013 −D(v) (5.3.16) The problem is that we need the K ¨ahler potential K0 as a function of the invariant ϖ. Utilizing eqn. (5.3.15) it is fairly easy to obtain the expression of ϖ in terms of the moment v for a generic function D(v) that codifies the geometry of the base-manifold, obtaining ϖ = (1 +exp[2xu])2 exp[2xu] =Ω(v) =4vexp[2∂vD(v)+ 1] (5.3.17) If one is able to invert the function Ω(v), the original K¨ahler potential of the base-manifold can be written as: K0 (ϖ) =K0 ◦ Ω−1 (ϖ) (5.3.18) 117The inverse functionΩ−1 (ϖ) can be written explicitly in some simple cases, but not always, and this inversion is the main reason why certain K¨ahler metrics can be much more easily found in the AMSY symplectic formalism which deals only with real variables than in the complex formalism. Since nothing good comes without paying a price, the metrics found in the symplectic approach require that the ranges of the variables u and v should be determined, since it is just in those ranges that the topology and algebraic structure of the underlying manifold is hidden; indeed the ranges of u and v define a convex closed polytope in the R2 plane that encodes very precious information about the structure of the underlying manifold. 5.4 The Ricci tensor and the Ricci form of the base manifold MB Calculating the Ricci tensor for the family of metrics (5.3.2) we obtain the following structure: RicMB µν =   PU 02×2 02×2 PD ! (5.4.1) The expressions for PU and PD are quite lengthy and we omit them. We rather consider the Ricci 2-form defined by: RicMB = RicMB µν dqµ ∧dqν (5.4.2) where: RicMB = RicMB JMB =   02×2 R −RT 02×2 ! (5.4.3) and R =   r11 r12 r21 r22 ! r11 = 2v(vf ′(v)+2vf (v)2+f (v))−1 2v(2vf (v)+1)2 r12 = 0 r21 = 2uv \u0000 v2(2vf (v)+ 1)f ′′(v)−4v3f ′(v)2 +4vf ′(v)−4v2f (v)3 −2vf (v)2 +3f (v) \u0001 +u 2v2(2vf (v)+ 1)3 r22 = f (v) \u0000 2v2 (vf ′′(v)+ f ′(v))+ 3 \u0001 +v \u0000 vf ′′(v)−4v2f ′(v)2 +5f ′(v) \u0001 +2vf (v)2 (2vf (v)+ 1)3 RT = PD G−1 MB (5.4.4) The last equation is not a definition but rather a consistency constraint (the Ricci tensor must be skew-symmetric). A two-parameter family of KE metrics forMB. An interesting and legitimate question is whether the family of cohomogeneity one metrics (5.3.10) that we name Met (FV ) since they are parameterized by the function FK (v), contains K ¨ahler Einstein ones. The answer is positive, and the KE metrics make up a two-parameter subfamily. As it will be shown in the next section, such a KE family Met(FV )KE is a subfamily of a 4-parameter family of extremal metrics Met(FV )ext found many decades ago by Calabi. Let us first directly retrieve the KE family from the appropriate differential constraint. A metric is KE if the Ricci 2-form is proportional to the K¨ahler 2-form: RicMB = k 4 KMB (5.4.5) 118where k is a constant. This amounts to requiring that the 2×2 matrix R displayed in eqn. (5.4.4) be proportional via k 4 to the identity matrix 12×2. This condition implies differential constraints on the function f (v) that are uniquely solved by the following function: f (v) = −3β +kv3 +3v2 −2kv4 +6v3 +6βv (5.4.6) the parameter β being the additional integration constant, while k is defined by equation (5.4.5). To retrieve the original symplectic potential D(v) one has just to perform a double integration in the variable v. The explicit calculation of the integral requires a summation over the three roots λ1,2,3 of the following cubic polynomial: P(x) =x3 − 3x2 k − 3β k (5.4.7) whose main feature is the absence of the linear term. Hence a beautiful way of parameterizing the family of KE metrics is achieved by using as parameters two of the three roots of the polynomial (5.4.7). Let us call the independent roots λ1 and λ2. The polynomial (5.4.7) is reproduced by setting: k = 3(λ1 +λ2) λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 , β = − λ2 1 λ2 2 λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 , λ3 = − λ1λ2 λ1 +λ2 (5.4.8) Substituting (5.4.8) in eqn. (5.4.6) we obtain f (v) = − λ1v2(λ2+v)+λ2v2(λ2+v)+λ2 1 (λ2 2 +v2) 2v(v−λ1)(v−λ2)(λ2v+λ1(λ2+v)) (5.4.9) which is completely symmetrical in the exchange of the two independent roots λ1,λ2. Utilizing the expression (5.4.9) the double integration is easily performed, and we obtain the following explicit result, where we omitted irrelevant linear terms: DKE (v) = −(λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 )(v−λ1)log(v−λ1) λ2 1 +λ2λ1−2λ2 2 −(λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 )(v−λ2)log(v−λ2) −2λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 +(λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 )(λ2v+λ1(λ2+v))log(λ2v+λ1(λ2+v)) (λ1+λ2)(2λ2 1 +5λ2λ1+2λ2 2 ) − 1 2 vlog(v) (5.4.10) Comparing with the original papers on the AMSY formalism [57, 58], we note that the full symplectic potential for the 4-manifold MB has precisely the structure of what is there called a natural symplectic potential Gnatural = r ∑ ℓ=1 cℓ pℓ (u,v)×log[pℓ (u,v)] ; pℓ (u,v) =linear functions of the moments (5.4.11) (with r = 4 in our case). The only difference is that in [57] the coefficients cℓ are all equal while here they differ one from the other in a precise way that depends on the parameters λ1, λ2 defining the metric and the argument of the logarithms. As we are going to discuss later on, the same thing happens also for the nonKE metric on the second Hirzebruch surface F2 derived from the Kronheimer construction. Next we turn to a general discussion of the properties of the metrics in Met (FV ) and to the organization of the latter into special subfamilies. This will also clarify the precise location of the KE metrics in the general landscape. 1195.5 Properties of the family of metrics Met(FV ) Let us then perform a study of the considered class of 4-dimensional metrics. We do not start from a given manifold but rather from the family of metrics Met(FV ) parameterized by the choice of the function FK (v) of one variable v, given explicitly in coordinate form. The first tasks we are confronted with are the definition of the maximal extensions of our coordinates, and the search of possible singularities in the metric and/or in the Riemannian curvature, which happens to be the cleanest probing tool. Secondly we might calculate integrals of the Ricci and K ¨ahler 2-forms as it was done in papers [24, 25]. All this information can easily computed since everything reduces to the evaluation of a few integral-differential functionals of the function FK (v). Thirdly, one might construct geodesics relatively to the given metric and explore their behavior. This is probably the finest and most accurate tool to visualize the geometry of a manifold and was explicitly done in [25] showing also that the geodesics equation are fully integrable due to the presence of an additional hamiltonian in involution with the principal one. In these lectures I will skip reviewing such results since although interesting they are somehow aside from the main issue that is that of establishing holographic dual pairs. The explicit integration of the complex structure was also performed in [25], but we skip it here for the same reason as above. 5.5.1 Analysis of the family of metrics We begin by observing that all the metrics deriving from the symplectic potential defined by eqn.s (5.3.4),(5.3.5)2 admit the general form which we already displayed in (5.3.10). Furthermore the change of coordinates performed to arrive at (5.3.10) clearly reveals that all the three dimensional sections of MB obtained by fixing v = const are S1 fibrations on S2 which is consistent with the isometry SU (2) × U(1). Indeed all the spaces MB have cohomogeneity equal to one and the moment variable v is the only one whose dependence is not fixed by isometries. The next important point is that the metric (5.3.10) is positive definite only in the interval of the positive v- axis where FK (v) ≥ 0. Let us name the lower and upper endpoints of such intervalvmin and vmax, respectively. If the interval [vmin,vmax] is finite, then the space MB is compact and the domain of the coordinates u,v is provided by the trapezoidal polytope displayed in Figure 5.2. Our two main examples, which both correspond to the same universal polytope of Figure 5.2, are provided by the case of the one-parameter family ofKronheimer metrics on the F2-surface, studied in [24, 23], whose K¨ahler potential was given in eqn. (5.1.16)), and by a family Met (FV )ext of extremal K¨ahler metrics due to Calabi that we illustrate below and which includes the above described K¨ahler Einstein metrics. In addition, within the first class, we have the degenerate case where the parameter α goes to zero and the trapezoid degenerates into a triangle. That case corresponds to the singular space MB = WP[1,1,2] (a weighted projective plane). Extremal metrics are defined in the present cohomogeneity one case by the differential equation (see [60]): ∂2 ∂v2 Rs(v) =0 (5.5.1) where Rs(v) is the scalar curvature. Inserting in eqn.(5.5.1) the expression of Rs calculated later in eqn.(5.5.21) we obtain the following linear differential equation of order four: v2 \u0000 −FK (3)(v) \u0001 +2vFK ′′(v)−2FK ′(v)+ 2 v3 − 1 2FK (4)(v) =0 (5.5.3) whose general integral contains four integration constants (we name them A ,B,C,D) and can be written as 2In this section which deals only with the base manifold MB and where there is no risk of confusion we drop the suffix 0 in the moment variables, in order to make formulas simpler. 120vmaxvmin v u/2 Figure 5.2: The universal polytope in the v, u 2 plane for all the metrics of the MB manifolds considered in these lectures and defined in equation (5.3.10) follows: FK ext(v) = −A +8Cv3 −16Dv4 +4v2 −2vB 4v (5.5.4) The explicit expression (5.5.4) is very much inspiring and useful. The functionFK ext(v) is rational and it is the quotient of a quartic polynomial with a fixed coefficient of the quadratic term divided by the linear polynomial 4v. A convenient way of parameterizing the entire family of metrics is therefore in terms of the four roots λ1,λ2,λ3,λ4, as we did in section 5.4 for the cubic polynomial of eqn.(5.4.7) (see eqn. (5.4.8)). Combining eqn.(5.4.6) with eqn.s (5.3.9) and (5.3.11) we obtain the expression of the functionFK KE corresponding to the KE metrics: FK KE (v) = 3β −kv3 +3v2 3v (5.5.5) Comparing eqn. (5.5.5) with eqn. (5.5.4) we see that the KE metrics belong to the family of extremal metrics and are singled out by the constraint A = −4β ; B = 0 ; C = k 6 ; D = 0 (5.5.6) The most relevant aspect of the above eqn. (5.5.6) is the suppression of the quartic and linear terms (D = B = 0), which fixes the number of free roots to two, as we know, the third being fixed in terms ofλ1,λ2. We have summarized the relevant choices of the functionFK (v) in Table 5.1. Inspecting this table we see that the functions FK F2 Kro(v) and FK KE (v) show strict similarities but also a difference which is expected to account for different topologies. In both cases the function FK (v) is the ratio of a cubic polynomial having three real roots, two positive and one negative, and of a denominator that has no zeros in the[vmin,vmax] interval. In the KE case there is a simple pole at v = 0 while for F2 (which is not KE) the denominator has two zeros and therefore FK (v) has two simple poles at vpoles = 9 32 h (3α +4)±2 √ 2 p α2 +3α +2 i (5.5.7) 121FK F2 Kro(v) = (1024v2−81α2)(32v−9(3α+4)) 16(81α2+1024v2−576(3α+4)v) vmin = 9α 32 vmax = 9 32 (3α +4) α > 0 FK WP[1,1,2] Kro (v) = v(8v−9) 4v−9 vmin = 0 vmax = 9 8 α = 0 FK ext(v) = −A +8Cv3−16Dv4+4v2−2vB 4v vmin = λr 1 vmax = λr 2 0 < λr 1 < λr 2 FK KE (v)| {z } B=D=0 = −(v−λ1)(v−λ2)(λ2v+λ1(λ2+v)) (λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 )v vmin = λ1 vmax = λ2 0 < λ1 < λ2 FK KE 0 (v) = v(λ2−v) λ2 vmin = 0 vmax = λ2 λ2 > 0 FK cone(v) =v vmin = 0 vmax = ∞ FK F2 ext(v) = (a−v)(b−v)(a2(3b−v)+a(b2+4bv+3v2)+bv(b+v)) v(a3+3a2b−3ab2−b3) vmin = a vmax = b b > a > 0 (5.5.2) Table 5.1: Notable choices for the function FK . These poles are out of the interval [vmin,vmax] for any positive α > 0, namely these poles do not correspond to points of the manifold MB, just as it is the case for the single pole v = 0 in the KE case. One also notes that the function FK F2 ext(v) cannot be reduced to the form (5.5.4) by any choice of the parameters A ,B,C,D, so that the smooth K¨ahler metric induced on the second Hirzebruch surface by the Kronheimer construction ([24, 23]) is not an extremal metric. A consistency check comes from the evaluation onFK F2 Kro(v) of the scalar curvature provided by the later eqn.(5.5.21). In this case the scalar curvature is in no way linear in v, being a rational function of degree 6 in the numerator and of degree 7 in the denominator. The same is true of the limiting case α → 0. The last case (FK (v) =v) corresponds to a metric cone on the 3-sphere, i.e.,C2/Z2 with a flat metric. The case FK KE 0 will be discussed in Section 5.5.3. Finally in table 5.1 we observe the choice of the function FK F2 ext(v) = (a −v)(b −v) \u0000 a2(3b −v)+ a \u0000 b2 +4bv+3v2\u0001 +bv(b +v) \u0001 v(a3 +3a2b −3ab2 −b3) (5.5.8) 122That above in eqn.(5.5.8) is a particular case of the general case FK ext(v), corresponding to the following choice of the parameters: A = − 4a2b2(3a +b) a3 +3a2b −3ab2 −b3 ; B = 8a3b a3 +3a2b −3ab2 −b3 C = − 2a2 a3 +3a2b −3ab2 −b3 ; D = 3a +b 4(−a3 −3a2b +3ab2 +b3) (5.5.9) where the parameters a,b are real, positive and naturally ordered b > a > 0. Wherefrom does the special form (5.5.9) originate? We claim that the metric defined by the function (5.5.8) is a smooth metric on the smooth F2 surface. The algebraic constraints that reduce the four parameters A ,B,C,D to the form (5.5.9) are derived from the conditions, already preliminarily discussed in [23] and specifically worked out in section 8.2.2 of [24], on the periods of the Ricci two-form localized on the standard toric homology cyclesC1 and C2 of F2 (see section 4.4 and in particular table 4.3). Utilizing eqn.s (5.5.26) and (5.5.27) derived in the next section 5.5.2 we have (see also eqn.(8.14) of [24]): Ric |C1 = A(v) sin[θ]dθ ∧dφ ; Ric |C2 = C(v)dθ ∧dφ (5.5.10) the relevant functions being given in (5.5.27). The conditions on the periods are as follows: 1 2π Z C1 Ric = 0 ; 1 2π Z C2 Ric = 2 (5.5.11) that, as shown in section 8.2.2 of [24]) are automatically verified by the Kronheimer metric. The two conditions (5.5.11) become two statements on the functionsA(v),D(v) defined in eqn. (5.5.27) and completely determined in terms of the function FK (v) and its derivatives: A[vmin] =0 ; Z vmax vmin D[v]dv = 2 (5.5.12) The result provided in eqn. (5.5.8) corresponding to the parameter choice (5.5.9) is deduced in the following way. First we re-parameterize the function (5.5.4) in terms of the four roots of the quartic polynomial appearing in the numerator that we name µ1,µ2,µ3,µ4 obtaining: FK ext(v) = µ1 (v(µ3 +v)(µ4 +v)+ µ2 (µ3 (v−µ4)+ v(µ4 +v))) 2v(v−µ1)(v−µ2)(v−µ3)(v−µ4) + µ2 (µ3 +v)(µ4 +v)+ v(v(µ4 −v)+ µ3 (µ4 +v)) 2(v−µ1)(v−µ2)(v−µ3)(v−µ4) (5.5.13) Secondly we rename µ2 = a,µ3 = b deciding that 0 < a < b < ∞ and we calculate the two conditions (5.5.12) using the function FK ext(v) in eqn.(5.5.13) as an input. We get a system of quadratic algebraic equations for the remaining roots µ1,µ4 that has the following solutions µ2 = a ; µ3 = b µ1 = a2 − \u0010 b2 ± √ a4 −44a3b −10a2b2 +4ab3 +b4 \u0011 −4ab 6a +2b µ4 = a2 − \u0010 b2 ∓ √ a4 −44a3b −10a2b2 +4ab3 +b4 \u0011 −4ab 6a +2b (5.5.14) 123Substitution of eqn.(5.5.14) into eqn. (5.5.13) produces the function FK F2 ext(v) presented in (5.5.13) and re- called in table 5.1. Furthermore as long as the roots µ1,µ4 as given above are complex conjugate of each other or, being real, do not fall in the interval [a,b], then the K ¨ahler metric generated by the function FK F2 ext(v) is smooth and well defined on the second Hirzebruch surface F2. The domain where this happens in the plane a,b can be easily studied looking at the discriminant under the square root in (5.5.14). 5.5.2 Vielbein formalism and the curvature 2-form of MB The metric (5.3.10) is in diagonal form so it is easy to write a set of vierbein 1-forms. Indeed if we set ei = ( dvp FK (v) , p FK (v) [dφ(1 −cosθ)+ dτ], √ vdθ, √ vdφ sinθ ) (5.5.15) the line element (5.3.10) reads ds2 B = 4 ∑ i=1 ei ⊗ei (5.5.16) Furthermore we can calculate the matrix vielbein and its inverse quite easily, obtaining: ei = Ei µ dyµ ; yµ = {v,θ,φ,τ} Ei µ =   1√ FK (v) 0 0 0 0 0 p FK (v)(1 −cosθ) p FK (v) 0 √v 0 0 0 0 √vsinθ 0   Eν j =   p FK (v) 0 0 0 0 0 1√v 0 0 0 0 csc(θ)√v 0 1√ FK (v) 0 (cosθ−1)cscθ√v   (5.5.17) By means of the MATHEMATICA package VIELBGRAV 233 we can easily calculate the Levi-Civita spin connec- tion and the curvature 2-form from the definitions 0 = Ti = dei + ωi j ∧ ej ; Ri j = dωi j + ωik ∧ ωk j = Ri j kℓ ek ∧ eℓ (5.5.18) 3VIELBGRAV 23 is a MATHEMATICA package for the calculation of the spin connection the curvature 2-form and the intrinsic components of the Riemann tensor in vielbein formalism. Constantly updated, it was originally written by the present author, almost thirty years ago. It can be furnished upon request and it will be at disposal on the the De Gruyter site for the readers of a forthcoming book entitled Discrete Finite and Lie Groups. 124obtaining R12 = −FK ′′(v) 2 e1 ∧e2 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 2v2 e3 ∧e4 R13 = −(vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e1 ∧e3 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e2 ∧e4 R14 = (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e2 ∧e3 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e1 ∧e4 R23 = (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e1 ∧e4 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e2 ∧e3 R24 = −(vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e1 ∧e3 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 4v2 e2 ∧e4 R34 = (v−FK (v)) v2 e3 ∧e4 − (vFK ′(v)−FK (v)) 2v2 e1 ∧e2 (5.5.19) Equation (5.5.19) shows that the Riemann tensor Ri j kℓ is constructed in terms of only three functions: CF 1(v) =FK ′′(v) ; CF 2(v) = \u0000 vFK ′(v)−FK (v) \u0001 v2 ; CF 3(v) =(v−FK (v)) v2 (5.5.20) If these functions are regular in the interval [vmin,vmax] the Riemann tensor is well defined and finite in the entire polytope of Figure 5.2 and MB should be a smooth compact manifold. From the expression (5.5.19) the MATHEMATICA CODE immediately derives the Riemann and Ricci tensors and the curvature scalar. This latter reads as follows: Rs = −vFK ′′(v)+ 2FK ′(v)−2 2v (5.5.21) and its form was used above to define the extremal metrics. Similarly in the anholonomic vielbein basis, the Ricci tensor takes the following form: Ri j =   FK (v)−v(vFK ′′(v)+FK ′(v)) 4v2 0 0 0 0 FK (v)−v(vFK ′′(v)+FK ′(v)) 4v2 0 0 0 0 − v(FK ′(v)−2)+FK (v) 4v2 0 0 0 0 − v(FK ′(v)−2)+FK (v) 4v2   (5.5.22) All the metrics in the considered family are of cohomogeneity one and have the same isometry, furthermore they are all K¨ahler and share the same K¨ahler 2-form that can be written as it follows: K = du∧dφ + dv∧dτ = e1 ∧e2 + e3 ∧e4 = 1 2 Ji j ei ∧ ej (5.5.23) where: Ji j =   0 1 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 −1 0   = δik Jk j (5.5.24) is the complex structure in flat indices. Utilizing Ji j the Ricci 2-form is defined by: Ric = Ri j ei ∧ej ; Ri j = Riℓ Jℓ j (5.5.25) 125and explicitly one obtains: Ric = A(v) sin[θ]dθ ∧dφ + B(v) (1 − cos[θ])dv∧dφ +C(v)dv∧dτ (5.5.26) In eqn. (5.5.26) the functions of v are the following ones: A(v) =−v(FK ′(v)−2)+ FK (v) 2v B(v) =−FK (v)−v(vFK ′′(v)+ FK ′(v)) 2v2 C(v) =v2 (−FK ′′(v))−vFK ′(v)+ FK (v) 2v2 (5.5.27) The F2 Kronheimer case. In the F2 case with the “Kronheimer” metric we have: CF F2 1 (v) = 331776(α+1)(α+2)(729α2(3α+4)+16384v3−3888α2v) (81α2+1024v2−576(3α+4)v)3 CF F2 2 (v) = − 9 32v2(81α2+1024v2−576(3α+4)v)2 × \u0000 6561α4(3α +4)+ 1048576(3α +4)v4 −1179648α2v3 +497664α2(3α +4)v2 −93312α2(3α +4)2v \u0001 CF F2 3 (v) = v− \u0000 1024v2 −81α2\u0001 (32v−9(3α +4)) 16(81α2 +1024v2 −576(3α +4)v) v2 (5.5.28) The three functionsCF F2 1,2,3(v) are smooth in the interval \u00009α 32 , 9 32 (3α +4) \u0001 and they are defined at the endpoints: see for instance Figure 5.3A. Indeed the values of the three functions at the endpoints are CF F2 1,2,3 (vmin) = n −128(α+1) 9α(α+2) , 32 9α , 32 9α o CF F2 1,2,3 (vmax) = n − 32(3α+4) 9(α2+3α+2) ,− 32 27α+36 , 32 9(3α+4) o (5.5.29) The singularity which might be developed by the space corresponding to the value α = 0 is evident from eqns. (5.5.29). The intrinsic components of the Riemann curvature seem to have a singularity in the lower endpoint of the interval, for α = 0. The case of the singular manifold WP[1,1,2]. In the previous section we utilized the wording seem to have a singularity for the components of the Riemann curvature in the case of the spaceWP[1,1,2] since such a singularity in the curvature actually does not exist. The space WP[1,1,2] has indeed a singularity at v = 0 but it is very mild since the intrinsic components of the Riemann curvature are well-behaved in v = 0 and have a finite limit. It depends on the way one does the limit α → 0. If we first compute the value of the curvature 2-form at the endpoints for generic α and then we do the limit α → 0 we see the singularity that is evident from equations (5.5.29). On the other hand, if we first reduce the function FK (v) to its α = 0 form we obtain: FK WP[1,1,2] (v) = v(8v−9) 4v−9 (5.5.30) and the corresponding functions appearing in the curvature are: CF WP[1,1,2] 1,2,3 (v) = \u001a 648 (4v−9)3 ,− 18 (9 −4v)2 , 4 9 −4v \u001b (5.5.31) 126Figure 5.3: A (left): Plot of the three functions CF F2 1,2,3(v) entering the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor for the “Kronheimer” metric on F2 with the choice of the parameter α = 1. B (right): Plot of the three functions CF WW112 1,2,3 (v) entering the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor for the Kronheimer metric on WP[1,1,2] with the choice of the parameter α = 0. Comparing this picture with the one on the left we see the discontinuity. In all smooth cases the functions CF F2 2,3 attain the same value in the lower endpoint of the interval while for the singular case of the weighted projective space, the initial values of CF WP[1,1,2] 2,3 (v) are different. which are perfectly regular in the interval [0,9/8] and have finite value at the endpoints (see Figure 5.3B). The case of the KE manifolds. In the case of the KE metrics the function FK (v) is FK KE (v) =−(v−λ1)(v−λ2)(λ1λ2 +(λ1 +λ2)v)\u0000 λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 \u0001 v (5.5.32) and the corresponding functions entering the intrinsic components of the Riemann curvature are CF KE 1,2,3 (v) = ( −2 \u0000 λ2 1 λ2 2 +(λ1 +λ2)v3\u0001 \u0000 λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 \u0001 v3 , 2λ2 1 λ2 2 −(λ1 +λ2)v3 2 \u0000 λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 \u0001 v3 , λ2 1 λ2 2 +(λ1 +λ2)v3 \u0000 λ2 1 +λ2λ1 +λ2 2 \u0001 v3 ) (5.5.33) the interval of variability of the moment coordinate v being the following v ∈ [λ1,λ2]. Correspondingly the boundary values are CF KE 1,2,3 (vmin) = \u001a − 2 λ1 , 1 λ1 − 3(λ1+λ2) 2(λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 ), 1 λ1 \u001b CF KE 1,2,3 (vmax) = \u001a − 2 λ2 , 1 λ2 − 3(λ1+λ2) 2(λ2 1 +λ2λ1+λ2 2 ), 1 λ2 \u001b (5.5.34) 127Figure 5.4: Plot of the three functions CF KE 1,2,3(v) entering the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor for the KE metric with the choice of the parameter λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2. We can use the case λ1 = 1,λ2 = 2 as a standard example. In this case the behavior of the three functions is displayed in Figure 5.4 The case of the extremal K¨ahler metric on the second Hizebruch surface F2. Finally we consider the case of the extremal metric onF2 discussed in the previous pages and defined by the function (5.5.13). In this case the three functions (5.5.20) parameterizing the curvature 2-form and hence the intrinsic components of the Riemann tensor are the following ones: CF F2ext 1 = 2a2b2(3a +b)−8a2v3 +6v4(3a +b) v3(a −b)(a2 +4ab +b2) (5.5.35) CF F2ext 2 = a3b(2v−3b)−a2 \u0000 b3 +2v3\u0001 +3av4 +bv4 v3(a −b)(a2 +4ab +b2) (5.5.36) CF F2ext 3 = 4a3bv−a2b2(3a +b)+ 4a2v3 +v4(−(3a +b)) v3(a −b)(a2 +4ab +b2) (5.5.37) A plot of the three functions for the extremal F2 metric, to be compared with the analogous plot relative to the Kronheimer metric (Fig. 5.3A) on the same manifold is shown in Fig.5.5. 5.5.3 The structure of M3 and the conical singularity The two real manifolds defined by the restriction to the dense chartu,v,φ,τ, of the surfaceF2 and of the manifold MKE B are fully analogous. Cutting the compact four manifold into v = const slices we always obtain the same result, namely a three manifold M3 with the structure of a circle fibration on S2: MB ⊃ M3 π− →S2 ; ∀p ∈ S2 π−1(p) ∼ S1 (5.5.38) 128Figure 5.5: Plot of the three functions CF F2ext 1,2,3 (v) entering the intrinsic Riemann curvature tensor for the extremal K ¨ahler metrics on F2 with with two different choices of the parameters a = 1, b = 2 and a = 1/3, b = 7/2. The metric on M3 is the standard one for fibrations: ds2 M3 = v \u0000 dφ2 sin2 θ +dθ2\u0001 + FK (v)[dφ(1 −cosθ)+ dτ]2 (5.5.39) The easiest way to understand M3 is to study its intrinsic curvature by using the dreibein formalism. Refer- ring to equation (5.5.39) we introduce the following dreiben 1-forms: εεε1 = √ vdθ ; εεε2 = √ v sinθdφ ; εεε3 = p FK (v)[dφ(1 −cosθ)+ dτ] (5.5.40) The fixed parameter v plays the role of the squared radius of the sphere S2 while p FK (v) weights the con- tribution of the circle fibre defined over each point p ∈ S2. At the endpoints of the intervals FK (vmin) = FK (vmax) =0 the fibre shrinks to zero. Using the standard formulas of differential geometry and once again the M ATHEMATICA packgage VIELB - GRAV23 we calculate the spin connection and the curvature 2-form. We obtain: R =   0 (4v−3FK (v)) 4v2 εεε1 ∧ εεε2 FK (v) 4v2 εεε1 ∧ εεε3 − (4v−3FK (v)) 4v2 εεε1 ∧ εεε2 0 FK (v) 4v2 εεε2 ∧ εεε3 −FK (v) 4v2 εεε1 ∧ εεε3 −FK (v) 4v2 εεε2 ∧ εεε3 0   (5.5.41) The Riemann curvature 2-form in flat indices has constant components and if the coefficient (4v−3FK (v)) 4v2 were equal to the coefficient FK (v) 4v2 the 2-form in eqn. (5.5.41) would be the standard Riemann 2-curvature of the homogeneous space SO(4)/SO(3), namely the the 3-sphere S3. What we learn from this easy calculation is that every section v = constant of MB is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere endowed with a metric that is not the maximal symmetric one with isometry SU(2)×SU(2) but a slightly deformed one with isometry SU(2)×U(1): in other words we deal with a 3-sphere deformed into the 3-dimensional analogue of an ellipsoid. At the endpoints of the v-interval the ellipsoid degenerates into a sphere since the third dreibein εεε vanishes. A conceptual picture of the full space MB is provided in picture Figure 5.6. 129Figure 5.6: A conceptual picture of the MB spaces that include also the second Hirzebruch surface. The finite blue segment represent the v-variable varying from its minimum to its maximum value. Over each point of the line we have a three dimensional space M3 which is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere but is variously deformed at each different value v. At the initial and final points of the blue segment the three dimensional space degenerates into an S2 sphere. Graphically we represent the deformed 3-sphere as an ellipsoid and the 2-sphere as a flat filled circle. Global properties of M3. Expanding on the global properties of M3, we describe it as a magnetic monopole bundle over S2, and prove that the corresponding monopole strength is n = 2. We start from the definition of the action of the SU(2) isometry (5.3.1) and describe the 2-sphere S2 spanned by θ and φ as P1 with projective coordinates U0, U1: U0 = r sin \u0012θ 2 \u0013 ei γ+φ 2 , U1 = r cos \u0012θ 2 \u0013 ei γ−φ 2 (5.5.42) where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, 0 ≤ φ < 2π, 0 ≤ γ < 4π. In the North patch UN, U1 ̸= 0 and the sphere is spanned by the stereographic coordinate uN = U0/U1, while in the south patch US, U0 ̸= 0 and the stereographic coordinate is uS = U1/U0. The transformation properties (5.3.1) define a line bundle whose local trivializations about the two poles are: φ−1 N (UN) = (uN, vN) = \u0012U0 U1 , ξ (U1)2 \u0013 , (5.5.43) φ−1 S (US) = (uS, vS) = \u0012U1 U0 , ξ (U0)2 \u0013 , (5.5.44) where ξ is a complex number in the fibre not depending on the patch. As (U0, U1) transform linearly under the an SU(2)-transformation:   U0 U1 ! →   d c b a !  U0 U1 ! , (5.5.45) the fibre coordinate v transforms so that (1 + |uN|2)2|vN|2 and (1 + |uS|2)2|vS|2, in UN and US, respectively, are invariant. The transition function on the fibre reads, at the equator θ = π/2: tNS = \u0012U1 U0 \u00132 = e−2iφ = e−inφ , (5.5.46) 130implying that the U(1)-bundle associated with the phase of v (i.e. the submanifold of the K ¨ahler-Einstein space at constant |v|), is a monopole bundle with monopole strength n = 2. This has to be contrasted with the Hopf- fibreing description of S3, for which the local trivializations have fibre components U1/|U1| and U0/|U0| in the two patches, respectively, andtNS at the equator is U1/U0 = e−iφ . In this case, the monopole strength is n = 1. Conical singularities and regularity of F2. Let us analyze the exact form of the singularities (when they are present). The restriction of the metric to a fibre spanned by v and τ ∈ (0,2π) is ds2 = dv2 FK (v) +FK (v)dτ2 . (5.5.47) Let λ denote one of the two roots λ1, λ2 of FK (v). Close to λ, to first order in v, in the KE case, the metric (5.5.47) is flat and features a deficit angle signalling a conifold singularity. This singularity is absent in the F2 cases, as expected. To show this let us Taylor expandFK (v) about λ: FK (v) =FK ′(λ)(v−λ)+ O((v−λ)2). (5.5.48) We can verify that: KE : FK ′ KE (λ1) =(λ2−λ1)(λ1+2λ2) λ2 1 +λ2 2 +λ1λ2 ; FK ′ KE (λ2) =(λ1−λ2)(2λ1+λ2) λ2 1 +λ2 2 +λ1λ2 , F2 Kronheimer : FK ′ F2|Kro \u00009α 32 \u0001 = 2 ; FK ′ F2|Kro \u0010 9(3α+4) 32 \u0011 = −2 F2 Extremal : FK ′ F2|ext(a) =2 ; FK ′ F2|ext(b) =−2 (5.5.49) Next we replace the first-order expansion of this function in the fibre metric: ds2 = dv2 FK ′(λ)(v−λ) +FK ′(λ)(v−λ)dτ2 , (5.5.50) and write it as a flat metric in polar coordinates: ds2 = dr2 +β2 r2 dτ2 . (5.5.51) One can easily verify that: r = 2 s v−λ FK ′(λ) , β = |FK ′(λ)| 2 . (5.5.52) Defining eϕ = β τ, we can write the fibre metric as follows: ds2 = dr2 +r2 d eϕ2 . Now the polar angle varies in the range: eϕ ∈ [0, 2π β]. If β < 1 we have a deficit angle: ∆φ = 2π(1 −β). Let us see what this implies in the various possible cases of Table 5.1. 1. In the case of the F2 manifold one has |FK ′(λ)| = 2 and β = 1, both for the Kronheimer metric and for the extremal one of the Calabi family, so there is no conical singularity, as expected. 1312. In the case of WP[1,1,2] we have FK (λ) =32λ2 −144λ +81 (4λ −9)2 . For the limiting value λ = 0 we obtain β = 1 2 , i.e., a C2/Z2 singularity, while for λ = 9 8 we have β = 1, i.e., no singularity, as we expected as WP[1,1,2] is an orbifold P2/Z2 with one singular point. 3. In the KE manifold case considering λ = λ1, we have: FK ′(λ1) =(λ2 −λ1)(λ1 +2λ2) λ2 1 +λ2 2 +λ1λ2 = −1 + 3λ2 2 λ2 1 +λ2 2 +λ1λ2 < −1 + 3λ2 2 λ2 2 = 2 ⇒ β < 1, (5.5.53) and |FK ′(λ2)| < |FK ′(λ1)|, so that β < 1 also at λ2. The manifold has two conical singularities, both in the same fibre of the projection to one of theS2’s. One of the singularities will be an orbifold singularity of type C2/Zn if the corresponding value of β is β = 1 − 1 n. (5.5.54) It is interesting to note that when this happens, the form of the function FK does not allow the other singularity to be of this type as well, as the corresponding integer m should satisfy m = 4n 2 +5n ± √ 9n2 +12n −12 (5.5.55) which is not satisfied by any pair (m,n) where both m, n are integers greater than 1; so the singular fibre can never be a football or a spindle. 4. We discuss the case λ1 = 0. In this case FK 0(v) =v(λ2 −v) λ2 . (5.5.56) If we focus on the fibre metric: ds2 = dv2 FK 0(v) +FK 0(v)dτ2 . (5.5.57) We can easily verify that in the coordinates eθ ∈ [0,π] and eϕ ∈ [0,π) defined by v(eθ) =R2 sin2  eθ 2 ! ≤ R2 = λ2 , eϕ = τ 2 , where R = √ λ2, the fibre metric (5.5.57) becomes ds2 = R2 \u0010 d eθ2 +sin2(eθ)d eϕ2 \u0011 . (5.5.58) Since eϕ = τ/2 ∈ [0,π), the fibre is the splindleS2/Z2. Topologically, the entire 4-manifold is stillS2 ×S2. 5. For FK (v) =v we get β = 1 2 , in accordance with the fact that the variety in this case is C2/Z2. In the cases 3 and 4 the singular locus is of the form S2 × p±, where p± are the “poles” of the fibres of the projection S2 ×S2 → S. In complex geometric terms, it is a pair of divisors, both isomorphic to P1. 132Conclusion on KE manifolds As we are going to see in next sections the condition that the base manifold MB should be a K ¨ahler Einstein manifold is essential in order to be able to construct the predicted Ricci flat metric on tot [K (MB)] by means of a general construction due to Calabi and named the Calabi Ansatz. In want of such a construction the solution of the Monge Amp`ere equation has so far resisted all attempts at going beyond a perturbative series. In any case the elaboration of the Calabi Ansatz within the AMSY action/angle formalism was not known and it was instead one of the main results of the recent paper [25]. Summarizing the previous discussion, we can say that, at the price of allowing the two above mentioned conical singularities one can start from a manifold almost identical and homeomorphic to the resolution of the C3/Z4 singularity, namely the F2 surface and subsequently apply the Calabi ansatz construction as I will report in the sequel. In this way one obtains an exact D3 brane solution. The conical singularities are one problem in the use of such an exact solution as a member of a holographic pair, yet there is another more intriguing one. The considered KE metrics are not a degeneration of Kronheimer metrics on the wall of a known chamber struture, rather they occur in another family, that of the extremal metrics, and at the moment it is not yet clear, as I will discuss in chapter 6, how such metrics might appear in a McKay quiver setup `a la Kronheimer. 5.6 The Calabi Ansatz and the AMSY symplectic formalism Having studied in some detail the KE base manifolds MKE B , we turn now to the main issue namely to the construction of a Ricci-flat metric on each of their canonical bundles. The Monge Amp `ere equations for the determination of such metrics can be written in general terms and it was studied in [24], yet as shown there, although an iterative series procedure is always available, exact solutions of such a partial differential non linear equation are difficult to be found. For that reason we turn to the method introduced by Calabi, which, however, works only for the case of KE base manifolds. Cautionary remark As we anticipated above the Calabi ansatz method produces a Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE \u0001\u0003 that one might be tempted to consider diffeomorphic to the Ricci-flat metric on the metric cone over the Sasaki-Einstein manifolds of [61]; actually this is not true, notwithstanding the very close relation of the K ¨ahler Einstein manifolds discussed above with the 5-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds of [61]. We have so far postponed the comparison of the KE metrics discussed in the above sections with the base manifolds of the 5-dimensional SE fibrations of [61] since such a comparison will be done more appropriately just in one stroke together with the comparison of the 6-dimensional Ricci-flat metrics. Calabi’s Ansatz Calabi’s paper [54] introduces the following Ansatz for the local K¨ahler potential K (z,z,w,w) of a K¨ahler metric gE on the total space of a holomorphic vector bundleE → M, where M is a compact K¨ahler manifold: K (z,z,w,w) =K0(z,z)+ U(λ) (5.6.1) where K0(z,z) is a K ¨ahler potential for gM , (zi, i = 1,... dimCM being the complex coordinates of the base manifold) and U being a function of a real variable λ, which we shall identify with the function λ = Hµν(z,z)wµ wν =∥ w ∥2 (5.6.2) i.e with the square norm of a section of the bundle with respect to a fibre metric Hµν(z,z). If θ is the Chern connection on E, canonically determined by the Hermitian structure H and the holomorphic structure of E, its local connections forms can be written as θ λ ν = ∑ i dzi L λ i|ν (5.6.3) 133where L λ i|ν = ∑ µ H λ µ ∂ ∂zi Hνµ ; [H λ µ] = ([Hλ µ]−1)T (5.6.4) The curvature 2-form Θ of the connection θ is given by: Θ λ ν = ∑ i,ℓ dzi ∧dzℓ S λ iℓ|ν ; S λ iℓ|ν = ∂ ∂zℓ L λ i|ν (5.6.5) The K¨ahler metric gE corresponding to the K¨ahler potential K can be written as follows: ∂∂K = ∑ i,ℓ h giℓ + λ U′(λ) ∑ λ,ν,µ HσµS σ iℓ|ρ wρwµ i dzidzℓ + ∑ σ,µ h U′(λ) +λ U′′(λ) i Hσµ ▽wσ ▽wµ. (5.6.6) If E is a line bundle then the above equation reduces to ∂∂K = ∑ i,ℓ [giℓ +λU′(λ)Siℓ]dzidzℓ +[U′(λ) +λU′′(λ)]H (z,z)▽w▽w (5.6.7) where λ = H (z,z)ww is the nonnegative real quantity defined in equation (5.6.2) and▽w denotes the covariant derivative of the fibre-coordinate with respect to the Chern connection θ: ▽w = dw + θ w (5.6.8) 5.6.1 Ricci-flat metrics on canonical bundles Now we assume that E is the canonical bundle K (M) of a K ¨ahler surface M (dimC M = 2). The total space tot[K (M)] has vanishing first Chern class, i.e., it is a noncompact Calabi-Yau manifold, and we may try to construct explicitly a Ricci-flat metric on it. Actually, following Calabi, we can reduce the condition that gE is Ricci-flat to a differential equation for the function U(λ) introduced in equation (5.6.1). Note that under the present assumptions S is a scalar-valued 2-form on M. Since our main target is the construction of a Ricci-flat metric on the space tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 , where MKE B denotes any of the KE manifolds discussed at length in previous sections, we begin precisely with an analysis of that case: this allows the derivation of a general form of U(λ) as a function of the moment w associated with the U(1) group acting by phase transformations of the fibre coordinate w, and of certain coefficients A,B,F that are determined in terms of the K ¨ahler potential K0 of the base manifold M. Consistency of the Calabi Ansatz requires that these coefficients should be constant, which happens in the case of those base manifolds that are equipped with a K¨ahler Einstein metric. KE metrics do not exist on Hirzebruch surfaces and the Calabi Ansatz is not applicable in this case. As we discuss in the sequel, there exists a Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle of a singular blow-down of F2, namely the weighted projective plane WP[1,1,2], which is known in the AMSY symplectic toric formalism of [57] and [58]. If we were able to do the inverse Legendre transform we might reconstruct the so far missing K¨ahler potential and get inspiration on possible generalizations of the Calabi Ansatz. Hence we are going to pay a lot of attention to both formulations, the K ¨ahler one and the symplectic one. 5.6.2 Calabi Ansatz for 4D K ¨ahler metrics with SU(2)×U(1) isometry The Calabi Ansatz can be applied with success or not according to the structure of the K ¨ahler potential K0 for the base manifold M and the algebraic form of the invariant combination Ω of the complex coordinates u,v which is the only real variable from which the K¨ahler potential K0 = K0(Ω) is assumed to depend. On the other 134hand Ω codifies the group of isometries which is imposed on the K¨ahler metric of M. In the case of the metrics discussed in section 5.3, that have SU (2)×U(1) isometry, the invariant is chosen to be Ω = ϖ (5.6.9) where ϖ was defined in eqn. (5.1.7). This choice guarantees the isometry of the K ¨ahler metric gM against the group SU(2) ×U(1) with the action described in eqn. (5.3.1). Hence we focus on such manifolds and we consider a K¨ahler potential for M that for the time being is a generic function K0(ϖ) of the invariant variable. In this case the determinant of the K¨ahler metric gM has an explicit expression in terms of K0(ϖ) det(gM ) =2ϖK0′(ϖ) \u0000 ϖK0′′(ϖ)+ K0′(ϖ) \u0001 (5.6.10) while the determinant of the Ricci tensor takes the form det(RicM ) = NRic DRic NRic = 2 \u0010 ϖ2K0′′(ϖ)2 +K0′(ϖ)2 +ϖK0′(ϖ) \u0010 ϖK0(3)(ϖ)+ 4K0′′(ϖ) \u0011\u0011 × × \u0010 −ϖ3K0′′(ϖ)4 +ϖ2K0′(ϖ) \u0010 ϖK0(3)(ϖ)−K0′′(ϖ) \u0011 K0′′(ϖ)2 +ϖK0′(ϖ)2 \u0010 −ϖ2K0(3)(ϖ)2 −K0′′(ϖ)2 +ϖ \u0010 ϖK0(4)(ϖ)+ 2K0(3)(ϖ) \u0011 K0′′(ϖ) \u0011 +K0′(ϖ)3 \u0010 3K0′′(ϖ)+ ϖ \u0010 ϖK0(4)(ϖ)+ 5K0(3)(ϖ) \u0011\u0011\u0011 DRic = K0′(ϖ)3 \u0000 ϖK0′′(ϖ)+ K0′(ϖ) \u00013 (5.6.11) and the scalar curvature Rs = Tr \u0000 RicM g−1 M \u0001 (5.6.12) is Rs = Ns Ds Ns = K0′(ϖ)3 +ϖ3K0′′(ϖ)2 \u0010 2ϖK0(3)(ϖ)+ 5K0′′(ϖ) \u0011 +ϖ2K0′(ϖ) \u0010 −ϖ2K0(3)(ϖ)2 +9K0′′(ϖ)2 +ϖ \u0010 ϖK0(4)(ϖ)+ 4K0(3)(ϖ) \u0011 K0′′(ϖ) \u0011 +ϖK0′(ϖ)2 \u0010 9K0′′(ϖ)+ ϖ \u0010 ϖK0(4)(ϖ)+ 6K0(3)(ϖ) \u0011\u0011 Ds = ϖK0′(ϖ) \u0000 ϖK0′′(ϖ)+ K0′(ϖ) \u00013 (5.6.13) Given these base manifold data, we introduce a K¨ahler potential for a metric on the canonical bundle tot[K (M)] in accordance with the Calabi Ansatz, namely K (ϖ,λ) =K0(ϖ) +U(λ); λ = exp[P(ϖ)]| {z } fibre metric H (ϖ) | w |2=∥ w ∥2 (5.6.14) where λ is the square norm of a section of the canonical bundle and exp [P(ϖ)] is some fibre metric. The determinant of the corresponding K¨ahler metric gE on the total space of the canonical bundle is detgE = 2ϖΣ(λ)eP(ϖ)Σ′(λ)(ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ)P′(ϖ)+ K ′ 0 (ϖ)(ϖP′′(ϖ)+ 2P′(ϖ))) +2ϖeP(ϖ)Σ′(λ)K ′ 0 (ϖ)(K ′ 0 (ϖ)+ ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ))+ 2ϖΣ(λ)2eP(ϖ)Σ′(λ)P′(ϖ)(ϖP′′(ϖ)+ P′(ϖ)) (5.6.15) where we set Σ(λ) =λ U′(λ) (5.6.16) 135If we impose the Ricci-flatness condition, namely, that the determinant of the metric gE is a constant which we can always assume to be one since any other number can be reabsorbed into the normalization of the fibre coordinate w, by integration we get λ = 1 48 \u0000 Aw3 +2Bw2 +4F w \u0001 (5.6.17) where we have set Σ(λ) = 2w A = 4ϖeP(ϖ)P′(ϖ)[ϖP′′(ϖ)+ P′(ϖ)] B = 6ϖeP(ϖ) [ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ)P′(ϖ)+ K ′ 0 (ϖ)(ϖP′′(ϖ)+ 2P′(ϖ))] F = 12ϖeP(ϖ)K ′ 0 (ϖ)[K ′ 0 (ϖ)+ ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ)] (5.6.18) In our complex three dimensional case, setting xu = log | u |, xv = log | v |, xw = log | w |, (5.6.19) the corresponding three moments can be named with the corresponding gothic letters, and we have u = ∂xu K (ϖ,λ), v = ∂xv K (ϖ,λ), w = ∂xw K (ϖ,λ). (5.6.20) As the fibre coordinate w appears only in the function U(λ) via the squared norm λ, we have w = 2λ U′(λ) =Σ(λ) (5.6.21) and this justifies the position (5.6.18). At this point the functionU(λ) can be easily determined by first observing that, in view of eqn. (5.6.17) we can also set U(λ) =U(w) (5.6.22) and we can use the chain rule ∂w U(w) =wλ′(w) 2λ(w) = 3Aw2 +4Bw+4F 2Aw2 +4Bw+8F (5.6.23) which by integration yields the universal function U(w) =− 2 √ 4AF −B2 arctan \u0010 Aw+B√ 4AF −B2 \u0011 +B log \u0000 Aw2 + 2Bw + 4F \u0001 −3Aw 2A (5.6.24) The function U(λ) appearing in the K ¨ahler potential can be obtained by substituting for the argument w in (5.6.24) the unique real root of the cubic equation (5.6.17), namely: w = 3 r 8 q (162A2λ +9ABF −2B3)2 −4(B2 −3AF)3 +1296A2λ +72ABF −16B3 3 3√ 2A + 4 3√ 2 \u0000 B2 −3AF \u0001 3A 3 r 8 q (162A2λ +9ABF −2B3)2 −4(B2 −3AF)3 +1296A2λ +72ABF −16B3 − 2B 3A (5.6.25) 136Consistency conditions for the Calabi Ansatz. In order for the Calabi Ansatz to yield a solution of the Ricci-flatness condition it is necessary that the universal function U (w) in eqn. (5.6.24) should depend only on w, which happens if and only if the coefficients A,B,F are constant. In the case under consideration, where the invariant combination of the complex coordinate u,v is the one provided by ϖ as defined in eqn. (5.1.7), imposing such a consistency condition would require the solution of three ordinary differential equations for two functions P(ϖ) and K0(ϖ), namely: k1 = 4ϖeP(ϖ)P′(ϖ)[ϖP′′(ϖ)+ P′(ϖ)] k2 = 6ϖeP(ϖ) [ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ)P′(ϖ)+ K ′ 0 (ϖ)(ϖP′′(ϖ)+ 2P′(ϖ))] k3 = 12ϖeP(ϖ)K ′ 0 (ϖ)[K ′ 0 (ϖ)+ ϖK ′′ 0 (ϖ)] (5.6.26) where k1,2,3 are three constants. It is clear from their structure that the crucial differential equation is the first one. If we could find a solution for it then it would suffice to identify the original K ¨ahler potential K0(ϖ) with a linear function of P(ϖ) and we could solve the three of them. So far we were not able to find any analytical solution of these equations but if we could find one, we still should verify that the K¨ahler metric following from such K0 is a good metric on the Hirzebruch surface F2. On the contrary for the well known K¨ahler potentials obtained from the Kronheimer construction that define a one parameter family ofbona fide K¨ahler metrics on F2 and were discussed in [17, 23], namely those presented whose K¨ahler potential is given in eqn. (5.1.16), equations (5.6.26) cannot be satisfied and no Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle can be obtained by means of the Calabi Ansatz. The general case with the natural fibre metric H = 1 det(gM ) . If we consider the general case of a toric two-dimensional compact manifold M with a K¨ahler metric gM derived from a K¨ahler potential of the form: K0 = K0 \u0000 |u|2,|v|2\u0001 (5.6.27) choosing as fibre metric the natural one for the canonical bundle, namely setting: λ = H |w|2 = 1 det(gM ) |w|2 (5.6.28) and going through the same steps as in section 5.6.2 we arrive at an identical result for the function U (w) as in equation (5.6.24) but with the following coefficients: A = 2 det(RicM ) det(gM ) , B = 3Tr \u0000 RicM g−1 M \u0001 , F = 6 (5.6.29) It clearly appears why the Calabi Ansatz works perfectly if the starting metric on the base manifold is KE. In that case the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor: Riciℓ = κ giℓ (5.6.30) and we get: det(RicM ) =κ2 det(gM ), Tr \u0000 RicM g−1 M \u0001 = 2κ (5.6.31) which implies: A = 2κ2, B = 6κ, F = 6. (5.6.32) 1375.6.3 The AMSY symplectic formulation for the Ricci-flat metric on tot[K (MB)] According with the discussion of the AMSY symplectic formalism presented in section 5.2, given the K ¨ahler potential of a toric complex three manifold K (|u|,|v|,|w|), we can define the moments u = ∂xu K , v = ∂xv K , w = ∂xw K (5.6.33) and we can obtain the symplectic potential by means of the Legendre transform: G(u,v,w) =xu u + xv v+ xw w − K (|u|,|v|,|w|) (5.6.34) The main issue in the use of eqn. (5.6.34) is the inversion transformation that expresses the coordinates xi = {xu,xv,xw} in terms of the three moments µi = {u,v,w}. Once this is done one can calculate the metric in moment variables utilizing the Hessian as explained in section 5.2. Relying once again on the results of that section we know that the K¨ahler 2-form has the following universal structure: K = du∧dφ + dv∧dτ + dw∧dχ (5.6.35) and the metric is expressed as displayed in eqn. (5.2.6)) The symplectic potential in the case with SU(2)×U(1)×U(1) isometries In the case where the K ¨ahler potential has the special structure which guarantees an SU (2) ×U(1) ×U(1) isometry, namely it depends only on the two variables ϖ (see eqn. (5.1.7))) and |w|2, also the symplectic potential takes a more restricted form. Indeed we find G(u,v,w) = \u0010 v− u 2 \u0011 log(2v−u)+ 1 2ulog(u) − 1 2 vlog(v) | {z } universal part G0(u,v) + G(v,w)| {z } variable part (5.6.36) where G(v,w) is a function of two variables that encodes the specific structure of the metric. Note that when we freeze the fibre moment coordinate w to some fixed constant value, for instance 0, the function G(v,0) =D(v) can be identified with the boundary function that appears in eqns. (5.3.4),(5.3.5), namely in the symplectic potential for the K¨ahler metric of the base manifold. With the specific structure (5.6.36) of the symplectic potential we obtain the following form for the Hessian (5.2.3): G =   − v u2−2uv 1 u−2v 0 1 u−2v −2v(u−2v)G(2,0)(v,w)+u+2v 2v(2v−u) G(1,1)(v,w) 0 G(1,1)(v,w) G(0,2)(v,w)   (5.6.37) 5.7 The general form of the symplectic potential for the Ricci flat metric on tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 Having seen that KE metrics do indeed exist in the form described in eqs.(5.3.2),(5.3.3), it is natural to inquire how we can utilize the Calabi Ansatz to write immediately the symplectic potential for a Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle of MKE B without going through the process of inverting the Legendre transform. Namely, we would like to make the back and forth trip via inverse and direct Legendre transform only once and in full generality rather than case by case. Our goal is not only a simplification of the computational steps but it also involves a conceptual issue. Indeed, when we introduce intermediate steps that rely on the variable ϖ whose range is [0,+∞) we necessarily have to choose a branch of a cubic equation whose coefficients are determined 138by the root parameters λ1,2. On the contrary, if we are able to determine directly the symplectic potential in terms of the symplectic coordinates, then we can explore the behavior of the metric and of its curvature on the full available range of variability of these latter and we learn more on the algebraic and topological structure of the underlying manifold. So let us anticipate the final result of our general procedure. As we did in the previous section we assume that the Ricci form of MB is proportional to the K¨ahler form via a coefficient κ = k 4 (5.7.1) as in eqs.(5.4.5),(5.6.30). The complete symplectic potential for the Ricci-flat metric on MT = tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 has the following structure: GMKE T (u,v,w) = G0 (u,v) +GKE (v,w) G0 (u,v) = \u0000 v− u 2 \u0001 log[2v−u]+ 1 2 ulog[u]− 1 2 vlog[v] GKE (v,w) = \u0000κw 2 +1 \u0001 DKE \u0000 2v κw+2 \u0001 − 1 2 vlog \u0000κw 2 +1 \u0001 + 1 2 wlog(w) +(κw+3)log(κw(κw+6)+ 12) 2κ + √ 3arctan \u0010 κw+3√ 3 \u0011 κ (5.7.2) where the second equation is a repetition for the reader’s convenience of eqn. (5.3.5) and DKE (v0) is the boundary function defined in equation (5.4.10); the relation between the two independent roots λ1,2 and the parameter κ ia provided by equations (5.4.8),(5.7.1). The reason while we have used the argument v0 = 2v κw+2 (5.7.3) is that the symplectic variable v0 associated with the base-manifold metric and the symplectic variable v associ- ated with the metric on the canonical bundleMKE T are not the same; their relation is precisely that in eqn. (5.7.3) which is a direct consequence of the Calabi Ansatz as we explain below. Derivation of the formula forGKE (v,w). The general formula (5.7.2) is a direct yield of the direct Legendre transform after the Calabi Ansatz: GMKE T (u,v,w) =xu u +xv v + xw w − K0(v0) − U(λ) (5.7.4) where λ = ww detgMB = const × ww exp[κ K0(v0)] =Λ(w) = 1 24 w \u0000 κ2w2 +6κw+12 \u0001 w 2 = λ U′(λ) U(λ) = U(w) = −3log \u0000 2 \u0000 κ2w2 +6κw+12 \u0001\u0001 +3κw−2 √ 3arctan \u0010 κw+3√ 3 \u0011 2κ K0(v0) = v0D′ (v0)−D(v0)+ v0 2 (5.7.5) The last two lines in eqns. (5.7.5) were derived earlier, respectively in eqns. (5.6.24),(5.3.16). The explicit form of U(w) follows from eqn. (5.6.24) using the KE condition, namely eqn. (5.6.32). From the above relations one 139easily obtains the relations u0 = 2u kw+2, v0 = 2v kw+2 xw = 1 2 {log[Λ(w)]−κ K0(v0)} (5.7.6) The first two relations can be understood as follows. The momenta u0,v0 are, by definition u0 = ∂xu K0 ; v0 = ∂xvuK0 (5.7.7) while we have u = ∂xu K ; v = ∂xv K (5.7.8) By the Calabi Ansatz we get: u = u0 +∂xuU(λ) =u0 +∂xuλ ∂λU(λ) =u0 +κ∂xuK0 λ∂λU(λ) =u0 \u0010 1 + κ 2 w \u0011 (5.7.9) A completely analogous calculation can be done for the case of v. Finally let us note that the coordinate xu,xv were already resolved in terms of u0,v0 in eqns. (5.3.15): xu = 1 2 (log(u0)−log(2v0 −u0)) ; xv = D′ (v0)+ log(2v0 −u0)− 1 2 log(v0)+ 1 2 (5.7.10) The information provided in the above equations (5.7.5) - (5.7.10) is sufficient to complete the Legendre trans- form (5.7.4) and retrieve the very simple and elegant result encoded in eqn. (5.7.2). To check the correctness of the general formula (5.7.2) we have explicitly calculated, by means of theMATH - EMATICA package METRICGRAV 4, the Ricci tensor for a few cases of M[λ1,λ2] T , always finding zero. The example of the metric [2,1]. Here we present the explicit form in symplectic coordinates of the Ricci-flat metric on the canonical bundle of the KE manifoldM[1,2] B , namely that determined by the choice:λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2. We get: ds2 M[1,2] T = dφ2 \u0010 −u2(9w+14)2 343v3 − 16464u2 (9w+14)4 +2u \u0011 + dv2 \u0000 u \u0000 2058v3 +(9w+14)3\u0001 −686v3(9w+14) \u0001 v(2v−u)(7v−9w−14)(14v−9w−14)(21v+9w+14) +2dτdφ \u0012 −u(9w+14)2 343v2 − 16464uv (9w+14)4 +u \u0013 + dudv u−2v + du(udv−vdu) u(u−2v) +36uw \u0000 27w2 +126w+196 \u0001 dχdφ (9w+14)3 +dτ2 \u0012 − 16464v2 (9w+14)4 − (9w+14)2 343v +v \u0013 + 6174v2dvdw (7v−9w−14)(14v−9w−14)(21v+9w+14) + dw2 \u0000 5647152v3 −343v2(9w+14)4 +(9w+14)6\u0001 2w(9w+14)(27w2 +126w+196)(7v−9w−14)(14v−9w−14)(21v+9w+14) +36vw \u0000 27w2 +126w+196 \u0001 dτdχ (9w+14)3 + 2w \u0000 27w2 +126w+196 \u0001 dχ2 (9w+14)2 (5.7.11) 4METRICGRAV just as VIELBGRAV 23 is a Mathematica package written by this author almost thirty years ago and constantly updated.

To develop our argument it is appropriate to begin by reformulating the geometry of the Ricci-flat metric derived from the Calabi ansatz in terms of vielbeins. In that language the comparison with the Sasaki-Einstein metrics of [61] becomes much more transparent. With some straightforward yet cumbersome algebraic analysis one can verify that, after the change of vari- ables (5.3.12), the Ricci-flat metric in action-angle coordinates coming from the symplectic potential GMKE T , as displayed in (5.7.2), can be rewritten as a sum of squares in terms of a set of six vielbein one-forms V i: ds2 MKE T = 6 ∑ i=1 \u0000 V i\u00012 = δi jV i µ V j ν | {z } metric gµν dyµdyν ; yµ = {θ,v,w,φ,τ,χ}| {z } coordinates (5.8.1) The explicit general structure of the sechsbein V i, whose matrix of components V i µ must be invertible and repro- duces the metric (5.8.1) is the following one: V 1 = √ vdθ V 2 = √ vdφ sin(θ) V 3 = dv A(v,w) V 4 = B(v,w)[dw + C(v,w)dv] V 5 = D(v,w) [dτ + (1 −cos(θ)) dφ] V 6 = E(v,w) [dχ + ℧(v,w)[ dτ + (1 −cos(θ)) dφ ]] (5.8.2) For the metric given by the symplectic potential in (5.7.2) the six functionsA(v,w), B(v,w), C(v,w), D(v,w), E(v,w), ℧(v,w) are explicitly given below, where, in order to make formulae more easily readable, we have renamed λ1 = α, λ2 = β : A(v,w) =− i q 64v3(α +β)(α2 +αβ +β2)6 −4v2 (α2 +αβ +β2)3 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))4 +α2β2 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))6 2√v(α2 +αβ +β2)3/2 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))2 B(v,w) = p NB(v,w)p DB(v,w) NB(v,w) =64v3(α +β) \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00016 −4v2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 \u0000 2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 +3w(α +β) \u00014 +α2β2 \u0000 2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 +3w(α +β) \u00016 DB(v,w) =2w \u0010 8 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 +9w3(α +β)3 +24w2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 (α +β)2 +24w \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 (α +β) \u0011 × × \u0010 8v3(α +β) \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 −4v2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 \u0000 2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 +3w(α +β) \u0001 + +α2β2 \u0000 2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 +3w(α +β) \u00013\u0011 C(v,w) = 24v2w(α +β) \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 \u0010 8 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 +9w3(α +β)3 +24w2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 (α +β)2 +24w \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 (α +β) \u0011 64v3(α +β)(α2 +αβ +β2)6 −4v2 (α2 +αβ +β2)3 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))4 +α2β2 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))6 D(v,w) = q −8v3(α +β)(α2 +αβ +β2)3 +4v2 (α2 +αβ +β2)3 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))−α2β2 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))3 2 q v(α2 +αβ +β2)3 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β)) E(v,w) = √ 2 vuutw \u0010 4(α2 +αβ +β2)2 +3w2(α +β)2 +6w(α3 +2α2β +2αβ 2 +β3) \u0011 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))2 ℧(v,w) =Ω(v,w) ≡ 3v(α +β) 2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β) (5.8.3) 141Properties of the sechsbein and comparison with Sasakian 5-manifolds. The general structure of thesechs- bein in (5.8.2) and (5.8.3) is very interesting since it highlights the double fibration structure of the underlying manifold MT which is a line-bundle (the canonical one) on the base manifoldMB which, in its turn, is a (singu- lar) P1 fibration over a base P1: MT π1 − →MB π2 − →P1 (5.8.4) The projection onto the base manifold is produced by considering the limit w → 0. Very much informative is the development in series of the sechsbein for small values of the coordinate w. The limit is regular for w = 0; two of the sechsbein (V 4,V 6) vanish and the remaining four 1-forms V 1,V 2,V 3,V 5 attain the values e3,e4,e1,e2 corresponding to the vierbein of the K ¨ahler-Einstein 4-dimensional metrics as given in eqn. (5.5.15) with the function FK KE (v) as given in table 5.1. At order √w there is no deformation of the base manifold vierbein, but the two vielbein corresponding to the fibre directions do appear. At order w we see the beginning of the deformation of the base-manifold vierbein. Precisely we find: V 1 = e3 V 2 = e4 V 3 = e1 +w∆e1 + O(w2) V 4 = 0 +√w∆ΦΦΦw +O(w3/2) V 5 = e2 +w∆e2 + O(w2) V 6 = 0 +√w∆ΦΦΦχ +O(w3/2) (5.8.5) where the deformations of the base manifold vielbein are as it follows: ∆e1 = − 3(α +β) q v α2+αβ +β2 \u0000 α2β2 −2v3(α +β) \u0001 2((v−α)(β −v)(αβ +v(α +β)))3/2 dv (5.8.6) ∆e2 = 3(α +β) \u0000 v3(α +β)−2α2β2\u0001 4(α2 +αβ +β2)3/2 p v(v−α)(β −v)(αβ +v(α +β)) [dτ +(1 −cosθ) dφ] (5.8.7) and the initial fibre-vielbein are instead the following ones: ∆ΦΦΦw = dw√ 2w ∆ΦΦΦχ = √ 2 \u0012 dχ + 3v(α +β) 2(α2 +αβ +β2) [dτ +(1 −cosθ) dφ] \u0013 (5.8.8) Comparison with the Sasaki-Einstein metrics. It is now the appropriate moment to consider the Sasaki- Einstein metrics introduced in [61]. In the coordinates utilized by those authors we have: ds2 SE5 = dy2(1 −cy) 2(a +2cy3 −3y2) + \u0000 a +2cy3 −3y2\u0001 (cdφ cos(θ)+ dψ)2 18(1 −cy) + 1 6(1 −cy) \u0000 dθ2 +dφ2 sin2 θ \u0001 (5.8.9) + ΦΦΦ2 SE 9 (5.8.10) ΦΦΦSE = [dξ + y(dψ +cdφ cosθ +dψ)−dφ cosθ] (5.8.11) 142If in equation (5.8.10) we apply the following coordinate transformation and we raname the parameters as fol- lows: a → 1 4 \u0000 3βk2 +4 \u0001 , c → 1, y → 1 − kv 2 , ψ → −τ −φ (5.8.12) we find the following interesting result: ds2 SE5 = k 12 bds 2 5 (5.8.13) bds 2 5 = ds2 KE4 + 4 3k ΦΦΦ2 SE (5.8.14) ds2 KE4 = dv2 FKKE(v) + FKKE(v)[dτ +(1 −cosθ) dφ]2 + v \u0000 dφ2 sin2 θ +dθ2\u0001 (5.8.15) KKE(v) =3β −kv3 +3v2 3v (5.8.16) As one sees the line element ds2 KE4 in (5.8.15) exactly coincides with the line element of the K ¨ahler Einstein metrics discussed in previous sections and presented in eqn. (5.3.10). It remains to be seen what is the appearance of the 1-form ΦΦΦSE after the transformation (5.8.12). If we add also the coordinate transformation: ξ → p χ + τ + φ ; p ∈ R (5.8.17) we find: ΦΦΦSE = p \u0014 dχ + k 2p v (dτ +(1 −cosθ) dφ) \u0015 (5.8.18) Comparing eqn.(5.8.18) with (5.8.8) we see that we obtain: ΦΦΦSE ⋉ ∆ΦΦΦχ (5.8.19) provided we choose the constant p as we do below: p = k α2 +α β+β2 3(α + β) = 1 (5.8.20) Hence, using eqn.s (5.8.12),(5.8.17),(5.8.20),(5.4.8) we can conclude that the Sasaki-Einstein metric of [61] with the choice of the parameters a,c provided in (5.8.12) is proportional through the constant k 12 to the following five dimensional metric: bds 2 ϒSE 5 = ds2 KE4| {z } KE metric on MB + 4 3k (dχ + Ω(v,0)[ dτ + (1 −cos(θ)) dφ ])2 | {z } limw→0 V 6√ 2w ≡ bg[5] i j dyi ×dyj (5.8.21) As it was explicitly checked in [25] the metric in eqn.(5.8.21) is an Einstein metric, since its Ricci tensor in intrinsic components takes the following form: Ric[bg[5]] = k 6 δi j (5.8.22) Hence the 5-dimensional variety ϒSE 5 implicitly defined by eqn.(5.8.21) is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. Indeed it is a circle bundle on the K¨ahler Einstein manifold MKE B : ϒSE 5 π− →MKE B ; ∀p ∈ MKE B π−1 (p) ∼ S1 (5.8.23) 143On the other hand, the standard metric of the metric cone on an Einstein space is certainly Ricci-flat. Hence writing a new sechsbein: Econe = {E1 ..., E6} (5.8.24) where: E1 = Re3 ; E2 = Re4 E3 = Re1 ; E4 = Re2 E5 = R r 4 3k \u0012 dχ + k 2v [dτ + (1 −cos(θ)) dφ ] \u0013 ; E6 = 2 r 3 k dR (5.8.25) we obtain the Ricci flat metric on the metric cone C \u0000 ϒSE 5 \u0001 by setting: ds2 C(ϒSE 5 ) = 6 ∑ I=1 \u0000 EI\u00012 (5.8.26) As reported in [25] with the help of the Mathematica Code VIELBGRAV 23 the curvature 2-form Rab con and the intrinsic components of the Riemann tensor Riecone were for the metric provided by the sechsbein (5.8.25). As the metric is Ricci-flat, the Riemann tensor coincides with the Weyl tensor Wcone(R,v). A similarly calculation was performed for the Ricci-flat metric constructed with the Calabi ansatz, using the sechsbein defined in (5.8.2) with the functions displayed in (5.8.3). In this way one obtains the curvature 2-form Rab CA and the intrinsic components of the Weyl tensor associated with the Calabi Ansatz metric WCA(w,v). In order to make the comparison more precise the sechsbein (5.8.2) was reordered in a similar way to the ordering utilized in the metric cone case: ECA = {V 1,V 2,V 3,V 5,V 6,V 4} (5.8.27) The two metrics exactly coincide on the base-manifold MB which is one of the KE manifolds with two conical singularities discussed at length in the previous sections of the present lectures and they are both Ricci-flat in 6-dimensions, yet from all what we said in the present section they seem to be intrinsically different, since the Sasakian Einstein 5-dimensional metric as described in (5.8.21) cannot be obtained by fixing the fibre coordinate w to some appropriate constant value. Yet one might deem that there exists some clever change of coordinates that can map one metric into the other. To show that this is not the case one resorts to the calculation of Weyl tensor invariants for the two metrics to compare them. Furthermore in [25] the polynomial 2-form curvature invariants were also calculated, in particular the following 6-forms: Ch = Rab ∧Rbc ∧Rca = Tr (R∧R∧R) E = Rab ∧Rcd ∧Rf gεabcd f g (5.8.28) The considered Weyl invariants were instead the following ones: Quad1 = W [abi j]W [i jab] Cub1 = W [abi j]W [i jpq]W [pqab] Cub2 = W [i jpq]W [rpsq]W [rsi j] Cub3 = W [i jpq]W [rpsq]W [ris j] Quart1 = W [abi j]W [i jpq]W [pqmn]W [mnab] Quart2 = W [i, j, p,q]W [p,r,q,s]W [r,m,s,n]W [m,n,i, j] (5.8.29) 144The result of the calculations with one special choice of α,β is displayed in table 5.2.

Since the calculations are very long when the parameters are left symbolic the evaluation of the invariants was done in the reference case α = 1,β = 2. realizes that the Ricci-flat metric constructed by means of the Calabi Ansatz translated into action-angle variables is different from that associated with the Sasaki-Einstein metric recalled in (5.8.10). The strongest evidence is given by vanishing of the invariantE in one case and the non-zero and coordinate dependent structure of the same invariant in the second case. However also the other invariants corroborate the same evidence. One can calculate the value of the coordinate R in terms of v,w by equating the quadratic invariant Quad1 of the two metrics. Substituting the result in the other invariants the two expressions do not agree for the other invariants. This being clarified one can try to understand the reason of the disagreement. In the Sasaki Einstein approach (5.8.14) corresponds to the standard construction of the metric on a U (1) bundle. To the metric of the base manifold, in the present case MKE B , one adds the square of a 1-form Φ of the type Φ = dτ + U(1)-connection on MB. The remaining coordinate is the radial one R. In the Calabi ansatz approach, instead, one directly constructs the line bundle on the base manifold. 5.9 The harmonic function and final remarks on the KE case As it appears in the most evident way from table 5.2, the Ricci flat metric produced on tot h K \u0010 MKE αβ \u0011i by the Calabi ansatz and that of the metric cone on the Sasakian Einstein Manifold defined by eqn. (5.8.25),(5.8.26) are essentially different and it is not even clear if they insist on the same six dimensional manifold, notwithstanding the fact that the 5-dimensional Sasaki Einstein manifoldϒSE 5 and K \u0010 MKE αβ \u0011 share the same base-manifold MKE B 145as it appears from the two fibrations (5.8.4) and (5.8.23) that we rewrite here below for comparison: tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 ≡ MT π1 − →MKE B ; ∀p ∈ MKE B π−1 1 ∼ C ⇕ ? ; C \u0002 ϒSE 5 \u0003 ι← −ϒSE 5 eπ1 − →MKE B ; ∀p ∈ MKE B eπ−1 1 ∼ S1 (5.9.1) The first fibration in eqn. (5.9.1) is a complex line-bundle, so that the standard fibre is a copy of C, while the second fibration is a circle bundle so that the standard fibre is a circle S1 whose local coordinate is the angle χ. The relation between tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 and C \u0002 ϒSE 5 \u0003 would become clear if the radial coordinate R of the metric cone might be interpreted as a monotonic function of |w|2 where w ∈ C is the local fibre coordinate on tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 according with the general prescriptions of table 4.3 and eqn.(5.1.2) and if the the metric (5.8.21) on ϒSE could be obtained in the limit R → 0 within the framework of the dimensional transmutation mechanism that involves the harmonic function H(R). In order to explain this crucial point it is necessary to go back to the complete 10-dimensional metric as displayed in (2.2.2). Let us adapt that general formula to our considered case: ds2 [10] = H (R[w])−1 2 \u0000 −ηµν dxµ ⊗dxν\u0001 +H (R[w]) 1 2 \u0010 ds2 [6] \u0011 ds2 [6] =    ds2 MKE T = ∑6 i=1 \u0000 V i[w] \u00012 ds2 C(ϒKE 5 ) = ∑6 I=1 \u0000 EI[R] \u00012 ηµν = diag(+,−,−,−) (5.9.2) In six dimensions for manifolds that are asymptotically locally euclidian, namely whose metric tends to the flat euclidian limit: ds2 [6] R→∞− →dR2 +R2ds2 C(ϒSE 5 ) (5.9.3) the harmonic function that respects all the isometries of the Sasaki Einstein 5-manifold ϒSE 5 has the following general form: H(R) =1 + 1 R4 (5.9.4) where the integration constant has been fixed in such a way that forR → ∞ the 10-dimensional metric approaches the locally Minkowskian limit: ds2 [10] R→∞− → −ηµν dxµ ⊗dxν + dR2 +R2ds2 C(ϒSE 5 ) (5.9.5) On the contrary in the opposite near brane limit R → 0 one obtains: ds2 [10] R→∞− →R2 \u0000 −ηµν dxµ ⊗dxν\u0001 + dR2 R2 | {z } AdS5 metric + ds2 C(ϒSE 5 )| {z } SE metric (5.9.6) which is the well known dimensional transmutation mechanism giving rise to the near–brane structure of 10- dimensional space: M[10] ∼ AdS5 ×ϒSE 5 (5.9.7) Superficially it might seem that all what is needed in order to match the above familiar dimensional transmutation picture are the following three conditions: 1) The Harmonic function on tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 , calculated with respect to its Ricci flat metric should be a function 146H(w) only of the moment w. 2) The radial variable R[w] ≡ 1 4 p H(w)−1 (5.9.8) upon suitable choice of the integration constants in the solution of Laplace equation for H(w) should be monotonic and map the interval [0,∞] of w into the same interval for [0,∞] of R. 3) The limit w → 0 should correspond to the limit w → 0 for the complex coordinate w along the fibres of the canonical bundle, so that the vanishing section of the canonical bundle corresponds to the near-brane geometry. As we are going to see in a moment the above three conditions can all be satisfied, yet this is not sufficient because of the following subtle point. In equation (5.9.2) we have carefully emphasized that the vielbein V i(w) of the Ricci-flat metric derived from the Calabi Ansatz, depend on the moment variable w just as the vielbein EI(R) of the metric cone on the SasakianϒSE 5 depend on the radial variableR. As for the first case the dependence on w is encoded in the functions (5.8.3) that partly appear as multiplicative factors in front of the various V i(w) partly inside their inner structure (see (5.8.2)). In the second case, instead the dependence on R of the vielbein EI(R) is just a multiplicative factor R in front of five of them. In order for the dimensional transmutational picture to work we need the three above mentioned conditions, but we also need that in the limit w → 0 five of the six vielbein V i(w) should approach as R[w] ×ei those ei of an Einstein 5-dimensional metric, in particular that of[61], while the sixth should approach d R[w]. As we already know this does not happen and there is no Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifold in the near-brane limit. 5.9.1 The harmonic function In any metric, Laplace equation for harmonic functions can be written as follows: △H(y) ≡ 1√detg∂I \u0010p detggIJ ∂J H(y) \u0011 = 0 (5.9.9) When we utilize a K¨ahler toric metric in symplectic coordinates, equation (5.9.9) simplify considerably because the determinant of the metric is identically equal to 1. Furthermore if we assume that the harmonic function is invariant with respect to all the toric U(1) symmetries H ≡ H(µµµ) depends only on the momentum variables and it does not depend on the angle variables Θi. Because of the structure in eqn. (5.2.6) eqn. (5.9.9) becomes: △H(y) ≡ ∂ ∂ µi \u0012 G−1 i j ∂ ∂ µj H(µµµ) \u0013 = 0 (5.9.10) Furthermore if we apply eqn.(5.9.10) to the case of the Ricci-flat metric onMT = tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 defined by the symplectic potential (5.7.2) and furthermore we assume that H(µµµ) depends only on the moment w we get the following ordinary differential equation: wH′′(w) \u0010 4 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 +3w2(α +β)2 +6w \u0000 α3 +2α2β +2αβ 2 +β3\u0001\u0011 +H′(w) \u0000 2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 +3w(α +β) \u00012 = 0 (5.9.11) 147Figure 5.7: Illustration of the monotonic behavior of the function R[w]. The general integral to the linear differential eqn.(5.9.11) is the following one: H(w) =c1 − c2 8(α2 +αβ +β2)2 \u0010 log h 4 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 +3w2(α +β)2 +6w \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 (α +β) i +2 √ 3arctan \"√ 3 \u0000 α2 +α(β +w)+ β(β +w) \u0001 α2 +αβ +β2 # −2log[w] ! (5.9.12) where h,k are the integration constants. The condition 2) in the above list is satisfied fixing: c1 = 1 −log \u0000 3(α +β)2\u0001 − √ 3π ; c2 = −8 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 (5.9.13) In this way one obtains: R[w] = n −log \u0002 3(α +β)2\u0003 +log h 4 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 +3w2(α +β)2 +6w \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 (α +β) i +2 √ 3arctan \"√ 3 \u0000 α2 +α(β +w)+ β(β +w) \u0001 α2 +αβ +β2 # −2log[w]− √ 3π )−1/4 (5.9.14) Independently from the values of the parameters α,β we can check that: lim w→0 R[w] =0 ; lim w→∞ R[w] =∞ (5.9.15) Furthermore some plots of the function for different allowed values of the parameters α,β shows the R[w] is monotonic (see fig.5.7). Near brane behavior of the 10-dimensional metric In order to appreciate the distance between the case of the metric cone and that of the exact D3-solution obtained with the Ricci flat metric generated by the Calabi- Ansatz, it is convenient to consider the asymptotic near-brane behavior of the 10-dimensional metric for w → 0 which means R → 0. In the neighborhood of R = 0 the relation between the momentumw and the radial variable becomes simple and clear. From eqn. (5.9.14) we find: R[w] w→0 ≈ 1 4 p −2log[w] ; w R→0 ≈ exp \u0014 − 1 2R4 \u0015 (5.9.16) 148Correspondingly we have H[w]−1/2 w→0 ≈ R2 H[w]1/2 w→0 ≈ R−2 (5.9.17) so that we find: ds2 [10] w→0 ≈ R2 \u0000 −ηµν dxµ ⊗dxν\u0001 + 2e− 1 2R4 R12 dR2 + 1 R2 ds2 KE4 + e− 1 2R4 R2 \u0000 ∆ΦΦΦχ \u00012 (5.9.18) where the initial fibre vielbein ∆ΦΦΦχ was defined in eqn.(5.8.8). As one sees there is no dimensional transmu- tation and no factorization into a product of spaces with separate metrics. In particular the Einstein metric of eqn.(5.8.21) does not emerge at all in the near-brane limit since its two terms (the base-manifold metric and the circle-bundle term) have completely different behavior in the radial variableR. In order to understand the rationale of this result I have considered the question if any Sasaki Einstein 5- dimensional manifold is included in the Riemannian manifold tot \u0002 K \u0000 MKE B \u0001\u0003 equipped with its own Ricci flat metric derived from the Calabi Ansatz. Having established that the radial coordinate R is a monotonic function of the moment coordinate w the question about the existence of a Sasaki-Einstein 5 dimensional sub-manifold ϒSE 5 can be posed in the following way. Taking the complete 6-dimensional metric defined by the symplectic potential (5.7.2) we reduce it to a 5-dimensional slice by setting dw = 0 keeping the value of w = const as free parameter. In this way one obtains a family of three-parameter ( α,β,w) metrics of which one can calculate the intrinsic components of the Riemann and Ricci tensors utilizing the Mathematica Code V IELBGRAV 23. The result of this calculation is very instructive. The Ricci tensor in intrinsic components turns out to be diagonal and we have: Ricii = 3(α +β) \u0010 4 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 +9w3(α +β)3 +18w2 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u0001 (α +β)2 +12w \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 (α +β) \u0011 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))4 i = 1,2,3,4 Ric55 = 9w(α +β)2 \u0010 4 \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00012 +3w2(α +β)2 +6w \u0000 α3 +2α2β +2αβ 2 +β3\u0001\u0011 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))4 (5.9.19) In order to have an Einstein metric we should have that the Ricci tensor is proportional to the Kronecker delta δi j; in other words we should find a value of w, (finite, null or infinite) for which the Ricci tensor gets all equal eigenvalues. Calculating the difference between the two eigenvalues of eqn. (5.9.19) we find: Ric11 −Ric55 = 12(α +β) \u0000 α2 +αβ +β2\u00013 (2(α2 +αβ +β2)+ 3w(α +β))4 (5.9.20) which vanishes only in the limitw → ∞. This is not very useful since the 5-dimensional metric is asymptotically flat and in the limit w → ∞ all components of the Riemann tensor vanish. Indeed we have: Rici j w→∞ ≈ 1 3w δi j + O(w−2) (5.9.21) It follows that in the near-brane regime and at finite distance from the brane no Sasaki-Einstein 5-dimensional metric emerges from the Ricci-flat one on the total space of the canonical bundle of the K¨ahler Einstein manifolds we have been discussing. 149Chapter 6 Open Questions In this chapter I illustrate the several questions and issues that remain open within the context of the Kronheimer construction and the analysis of K¨ahler metrics both on the base manifold MB and on the total space of the line bundles advocated in eqn. (5.1.5). 6.1 Open questions about the base manifold MB In section 5.5 we have studied the general properties of the family of 4 D-metrics (5.3.10) and, referring to eqn.(5.3.16), we have seen that the K ¨ahler potential of such metrics can be uniquely traced back, by means of the Legendre transform, to the boundary function D(v) appearing in the symplectic potential (5.3.4),(5.3.5). Furthermore we have seen that the same class (5.3.10) contains both the non-extremal K¨ahler metric induced on the second Hirzebruch surface by the Kronheimer construction and the entire family of Calabi extremal metrics that includes the KE Einstein metrics studied in depth in the present lectures. In view of these facts we want to reconsider the general structure of the D(v) that corresponds to all these cases as particular ones. We can write the following general formula: D(v) =q + pv +k0 v log[v]+ 4 ∑ i=1 ki (v− λi) log[v− λi] (6.1.1) where λi are the four roots of some quartic polynomial and ki ∈ R are four real coefficients. The real numbers q, p are arbitrary since the linear part of the D(v)-function does not change the metric and it can be chosen at will. We can fit into the general formula (6.1.1) the case of the non extremal K ¨ahler metric on F2 generated by the Kronheimer construction by choosing: λ0 = 0 λ1 = −9α 32 λ2 = 9α 32 λ3 = 9(4+3α) 32 λ4 = arbirary k0 = −1 2 k1 = 1 2 k2 = 1 2 k3 = 1 2 k4 = 0 (6.1.2) 150The case of the KE metrics is instead reproduced with the following choices: λ0 = 0 λ1 = a λ2 = b λ3 = ab a+b λ4 = arbirary k0 = −1 2 k1 = − a2+ab+b2 a2+ab−2b2 k2 = − a2+ab+b2 −2a2+ab+b2 k3 = a2+ab+b2 2a2+5ab+2b2 k4 = 0 (6.1.3) while the generic extremal K¨ahler metric in the Calabi family is characterized by the following choices: λ0 = 0 k0 = −1 2 λ1 = a k1 = a(a(b+s+t)+b(s+t)+st) (a−b)(a−s)(a−t) λ2 = b k2 = −b(a(b+s+t)+b(s+t)+st) (a−b)(b−s)(b−t) λ3 = s k3 = −s(a(b+s+t)+b(s+t)+st) (a−s)(s−b)(s−t) λ4 = t k4 = −t(a(b+s+t)+b(s+t)+st) (a−t)(t−b)(t−s) (6.1.4) The previous case of KE metrics is retrieved within the general description of eqn.(6.1.4) by means of a limiting procedure. One chooses the third root s in terms of the first two as follows: s = − ab a + b (6.1.5) and performs the limit in which the fourth root goes to infinity: t → ∞. In this limit the coefficient k4 goes to zero and we get back eqn.(6.1.3). The case of the extremal K¨ahler metric on F2 is instead derived from equations (6.1.4) introducing the relation: s =a2 + √ a4 −44a3b −10a2b2 +4ab3 +b4 −4ab −b2 6a +2b (6.1.6) t =a2 − √ a4 −44a3b −10a2b2 +4ab3 +b4 −4ab −b2 6a +2b (6.1.7) The main problem in relation with the question whether the extremal metrics and, among them the KE ones, 151can be connected with the Kronheimer construction and the resolution of an orbifold singularity C3/Γ becomes evident in the symplectic action/angle formalism at the level of the Legendre transform: to this effect we recall the result encoded in equation (5.3.16) which we repeat here for convenience: K (v) = 1 2 v + \u0000 vD′ (v)−D(v) \u0001 (6.1.8) which expresses the K¨ahler potential of the base manifold MB as a function of the moment variable v. Inserting the general expression (6.1.1) of the boundary function D(v) for the considered class of metrics into (6.1.8) we obtain the following general result for the K¨ahler potential as a function of the moment variable: K (v) =   1 2 + k0 + 4 ∑ i=1 ki ! v + 4 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.9) Comparing with eqn.(6.1.2),(6.1.4) we see that a property shared by the Kronheimer induced metric on F2 and all the extremal metrics is: k0 = −1 2 (6.1.10) Hence in view of eqn.(6.1.10) the structure of the K¨ahler potential (6.1.9) particularizes to the following one: K (v) =v 4 ∑ i=1 ki + 4 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.11) The main structural difference between the Kronheimer induced case and the extremal metrics, apart from the specific location of the roots λi, is the following: 4 ∑ i=1 ki =    3/2 ̸= 0 Kronheimer induced metric 0 Calabi extremal metrics (6.1.12) Hence in the case of extremal metrics the K¨ahler potential is just a sum of purely logarithmic terms: Kext (v) = 4 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.13) while in the Kronheimer case it is the sum of a linear term plus the logarithmic ones: KKro (v) = 3 2 v + 3 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.14) where we have taken into account that k4 = 0 as it happens also for the KE metrics. Why the presence or absence of the linear term is so much relevant? It is relevant in relation with the basic conjecture 3.4.1 since the K¨ahler potential on the exceptional divisor is supposedly obtained in a limiting procedure from the K ¨ahler potential inherent to the Kronheimer construction, namely that displayed in eqn.(2.6.32) and named HKLR after Hitchin, Karlhede, Lindstrom and Ro ˇocek [40]. Recalling the structure of the HKLR potential for the reader’s convenience: KMζ = KSΓ |Nζ +ζICIJLog[Det[HJ]] (6.1.15) we see that indeed it is composed of a non logarithmic term plus a sum of logarithmic ones, whose coefficients are linear in the Fayet Iliopoulos parameters (stability parameters in algebraic geometry parlance) and whose 152arguments are given by the moment maps HJ obtained solving the moment map equations. The first term KSΓ |Nζ is instead the pull-back on the level ζ hypersurface Nζ of the K ¨ahler potential for the flat K ¨ahler metric of the 3|Γ|-dimensional linear space containing all the scalar multiplets of the gauge theory. This term is necessarily positive definitive, because of its origin and, as I shew in eqn.(5.1.3), it is a rational function of the moment maps XI with coefficients that explicitly depend on the coordinates u,v,w. The limiting procedure for the reduction to the exceptional divisor is that outlined in eqn.(5.1.9) that can be schematized as follows: HJ → ℓαJ TJ ; ℓ ≡ |w| (6.1.16) where αJ are suitable powers (positive or negative) of the modulus of the fibre coordinate w, adopting the convention thatu,v are coordinates of the base manifoldMB i.e. the compact exceptional divisor in the resolution Y Γ → C3 Γ . What does it mean suitable powersαJ? It means that the limit ℓ → 0 of the moment map equations for the rescaled objects TJ is finite and that in the same limit the K ¨ahler potential is also finite. For the logarithmic addends in the K ¨ahler potential this is guaranteed a priori since terms of the form const ×log[ℓ] can always be disregarded in K being the sum of a holomorphic function plus its complex conjugate. The question remains for the first addend that is a rational function of the moments HJ. After the rescaling and in the limit ℓ → 0 there are three options. Either KSΓ |Nζ goes to a finite expression in terms of moments TJ, or to zero, or to infinity. The first two options are both acceptable, while the last has to be discarded, namely one has to try different powers αJ if they can be found. In the case of the C3/Z4 quotient, the limit lim ℓ→0 KSΓ |Nζ = K0 (6.1.17) turns out to be finite K0 < ∞ and one finds the result discussed at length both above and in previous sections. In this fully workable case the comparison of the K ¨ahler potential as obtained from the HKLR formula and as written in the symplectic formalism (6.1.14) is very instructive. Upon the back-transformation from the action/angle variables to the complex coordinates u,v, the linear term in v is just the non logarithmic addend: K0 = 3 2 v (6.1.18) while the logarithmic terms 3 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.19) reconstruct the logarithmic addends ζiCijLog[Det[Hj]] ⇔ 3 ∑ i=1 ki λi log[v −λi] (6.1.20) 6.1.1 Conclusions Hence the possibility of connecting the Extremal Calabi Metrics and, among them the KE ones, to resolutions `a la Kronheimer of orbifold singularities C3 Γ , obtaining in this way a full description of the holographic dual gauge theory, requires to accomplish successfully the following steps: A) Find a subgroup Γ ⊂ SU(3) such that the age grading of its conjugacy classes allows for the existence of compact components of the exceptional divisor. Desirably only one component, which means just one senior class. B) Arrange, if permitted, the scale powers in eqn. (6.1.16) so that the limit ℓ → 0 yields finite moment map equations and a K¨ahler potential with vanishing non logarithmic part K0 = 0. 153C) Investigate whether the logarithms of the moment maps logHj can be identified, upon Legendre transforma- tion, with suitable logarithmic addends (6.1.19). D) Verify with the help of toric geometry that the compact exceptional divisor is indeed the expected manifold for the extremal K¨ahler metric, for instance the second Hirzebruch surface. Independently from the extremal Calabi metrics the investigation of quotients C3 Γ with Γ non abelian and the features outlined in point A) of the above menu is quite timely in order to better understand the general pattern encoded in D(v) functions of the form (6.1.1) and the issue of cohomogeneity of the Kronheimer induced K¨ahler metrics. 6.2 Non abelian Kronheimer constructions The classification of finite subgroups of SU(3) was achieved at the beginning of the XXth century in [13, 14]. The explicit construction of such groups and a preliminary discussion of the resolutions of the corresponding C3/Γ singularities was discussed in [12]. Similarly to the Kleinian case of SU (2) finite subgroups, also for SU (3) there are infinite series of cyclic and solvable subgroups but there is only a short list of non abelian groups, somehow the analogues of the three symmetry groups of Platonic solids. In particular the largest non abelian finite subgroup of SU (3) is the simple group PSL (2,7) with 168 elements. The resolution of the singularity C3/PSL(2,7) was studied by Markushevich in [15] using standard blow-up techniques of algebraic geometry. All the subgroups of PSL (2,7) have an SU(3) embedding via the three dimensional complex representation of the father group and lead to interesting McKay quivers that define quite non trivial D3-brane gauge theories. The smallest non abelian subgroup of SU (3) is the dihedral group Dih3 of order six which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3. The associated Kronheimer construction for the resolution of the singularity C3/Dih3 was described in appendix E of [17] and the corresponding McKay quiver matrix was calculated there. 6.3 An Anthology of McKay quivers with comments In the present subsection we provide an anthology of McKay quiver diagrams for non abelian finite groups Γ ⊂ SU(3). Some of them are obtained as subgroups of the maximal non abelian group PSL (2,7) some other are constructed directly introducing their generators γi ∈ SU(3). Two are the critical informations we look for. On one side the quiver diagram from which we read off the gauge group of the D3-brane gauge theory and its scalar multiplet content, on the other hand the age grading of the conjugacy classes, which eventually predicts the number of components of the exceptional divisor. If we aim at a resolved transverse space that is a line- bundle L (MB) over a compact exceptional divisor MB we have to select discrete subgroups Γ ⊂ SU(3) that have senior classes. When all conjugacy classes are junior, the exceptional divisor is the union of non-compact manifolds and the whole picture that we have developed in the present lectures does not apply. As the reader can see from the shown examples, senior classes emerge less frequently that one might expect and this is a pragmatic criterion to investigate a subclass of groups more than others. 6.3.1 The smallest non abelian group Dih3 ⊂ PSL(2,7) Definition of Dih3 ⊂ SU(3) The presentation of the dihedral group Dihm is the following one A3 = 1 ; B2 = 1 ; (AB)2 = 1 (6.3.1) 154We introduce the following representation of the generators as matrices acting on C3 A =   e 2π 3 i 0 0 0 e−2π 3 i 0 0 0 1   (6.3.2) B =   0 i 0 −i 0 0 0 0 −1   (6.3.3) Conjugacy classes The total number of conjugacy classes is ℓ = 3 (6.3.4) that are enumerated as follows: C1 = ⟨E⟩ C2 =  B,AB,A2B \u000b , C3 =< A,A2 > (6.3.5) Hence we have one class of population 1, one class of population 3 and one class of population 2: |Dih3| = 6 = 1 +3 +2 (6.3.6) Irreps Accordingly we expect ℓ = 3 irreducible representations. They are as follows: 1. The one dimensional identity representation D0 2. The alternating one-dimensional representation D1, obtained by setting A → 1, B → -1. 3. The two-dimensional representation obtained in the following way: D2[A] =   e 2π 3 i 0 0 e−2π 3 i ! ; D2[B] =   0 1 1 0 ! (6.3.7) Characters In this way we obtain the following character table: 0 C1 C2 C3 × E B A D1 1 1 1 D2 1 −1 1 D3 2 0 2 cos \u00022π 3 \u0003 (6.3.8) The quiver matrix of Dih3 acting on C3 Using the above character table we easily derive the following decomposition into irreps: Q⊗Di = 3 ⊕ j=1 QCijDj (6.3.9) 155where Q is the three-dimensional representation of the dihedral group defined by eqs. (6.3.2,6.3.3) and Di are the irreducible representations listed above. The matrix QCij is the following CQ =   0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 2   (6.3.10) The graphical representation of the quiver is displayed in fig.6.1. The group has six elements and three represen- tations, the identity representation, a non trivial one-dimensional representation and a complex two dimensional representation. Correspondingly for a stack of N-branes at the resolved orbifold singularity, we expect a gauge theory with the following gauge group: FDih3 = S[U0(N)×U1(N)×U2(2N)] (6.3.11) and a total of 18 = 3× |Dih3 | scalar field multiplets in the one brane case N = 1. The symbol S in front of the product of U(m) factors means, as usual that the overall U (1) has to be factorized out. Looking at the diagram we easily see the field content of such a theory: Field U0(1)×U1(1)×U2(2) #of components Φ0,1 (1,1,1) 1 Φ1,0 (1,1,1) 1 Φ0,2 (1,1,2) 2 Φ2,1 (1,1,2) 2 Φ1,2 (1,1,2) 2 Φ2,1 (1,1,2) 2 Φ2,2 (1,1,4) 4 Φ′ 2,2 (1,1,4) 4 18 (6.3.12) The adjoint 4-dimensional representations can be given a mass and one can study the resulting quiver theory. Ages In a similar easy way we derive the age grading of the three conjugacy classes and the associated triple of integer numbers ai that define the weights in the weighted blowup procedure. Using the generators to obtain the matrix corresponding to each group element we find the following result: 156U0(N) U1(N) U1(N)U2(2N) Figure 6.1: The quiver diagram for the dihedral group embedding Dih 3 → SU(3) 1. age = 0 ; 1 {0,0,0} 2. age = 1 ; 1 2 {1,1,0} 3. age = 1 ; 1 3 {0,2,1} Hence apart from the age = 0 class of the identity we find two junior classes and no senior one. Hence we conclude that the Hodge numbers of the resolved variety MT are as follows h0,0 = 1, h1,1 = 2, h2,2 = 0, so that no (1,1)-class has compact support and the exceptional divisor has non compact component. 6.3.2 The case of the group PSL(2,7) Starting from the construction of the irreducible three-dimensional complex representation discussed in [16, 62], in [17] the age was computed of each of the conjugacy classes for the holomorphic action of the group PSL(2,7) on C3. In order to be able to compare with Markusevich’s paper [15], it is important to note that the form given by Markusevich of the generators which he calls τ , χ and ω, respectively of order 7, 3 and 2, does not correspond to the standard generators in the presentation of the group PSL(2,7) utilized by the present author in paper [16]. Yet there is no problem since we have a translation vocabulary. Setting: R = ω.χ ; S = χ.τ ; T = χ2.ω (6.3.13) these new generators satisfy the standard relations of the presentation displayed below: PSL(2,7) = \u0010 R,S,T ∥ R2 = S3 = T 7 = RST = (T SR)4 = e \u0011 (6.3.14) From now on we utilize the abstract notation in terms of ρ = R, σ = S, τ = T . We begin by constructing explicitly the group PSL (2,7) in Markushevich’s basis substituting the analytic form of the generators which follows from the identification (6.3.13). We find ε →   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   157ρ →   − 2Cos[ π 14 ]√ 7 − 2Cos[3π 14 ]√ 7 2Sin[π 7 ]√ 7 − 2Cos[3π 14 ]√ 7 2Sin[π 7 ]√ 7 − 2Cos[ π 14 ]√ 7 2Sin[π 7 ]√ 7 − 2Cos[ π 14 ]√ 7 − 2Cos[3π 14 ]√ 7   σ →   0 0 −(−1)1/7 (−1)2/7 0 0 0 (−1)4/7 0   τ →   i+(−1)13/14 √ 7 − (−1)1/14(−1+(−1)2/7)√ 7 (−1)9/14(1+(−1)1/7)√ 7 (−1)11/14(−1+(−1)2/7)√ 7 i+(−1)5/14 √ 7 (−1)3/14(1+(−1)3/7)√ 7 − (−1)11/14(1+(−1)1/7)√ 7 − (−1)9/14(1+(−1)3/7)√ 7 −−i+(−1)3/14 √ 7   (6.3.15) We remind the reader that ρ,σ,τ are the abstract names for the generators of PSL(2,7) whose 168 elements are written as words in these letters (modulo relations). Substituting these letters with explicit matrices that satisfy the defining relation of the group one obtains an explicit representation of the latter. In the present case the substitution 6.3.15 produces the irreducible 3-dimensional representation DA3. Utilizing this explicit representation it is straightforward to calculate the age of each conjugacy class and one obtains the result displayed in the following table. Conjugacy class of PSL(2,7) C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 representative of the class e R S T SR T SR order of the elements in the class 1 2 3 4 7 7 age 0 1 1 1 1 2 number of elements in the class 1 21 56 42 24 24 (6.3.16) According with the general results discussed in section 2.3.2 the resolved manifold Mζ|PSL(2,7) must have the following Hodge numbers: h(1,1) \u0000 Mζ|PSL(2,7) \u0001 = 4 ; h(2,2) \u0000 Mζ|PSL(2,7) \u0001 = 1 (6.3.17) and by Poincar´e duality one concludes that the exceptional divisor has four components, three non compact and one compact, whose geometry has to be derived. Expectations, Conjectures and Open Problems Indeed, from the experience developed in previous worked out examples, like that extensively discussed in chapter 4, and on the basis of the mathematical theory developed in papers [39],[32], we expect that there should be a chamber structure (see section 4.5) and that inside each chamber, away from the walls, the resolved manifold should be an appropriate line bundle: ζζζ = generic : Mζζζ|PSL(2,7) = L \u0000 MB|PSL(2,7) \u0001 π− →MB|PSL(2,7) ∀p ∈ MB|PSL(2,7) π−1(p) ∼ C (6.3.18) Whether such expectations come up true and the appropriate algebraic geometry identification of the manifold MB|PSL(2,7) is one of the open problems, probably the most difficult one, in the context of the investigations 158reviewed in these lectures. Similarly it would be quite important to identify the isometry group of the K ¨ahler metric induced on MB|PSL(2,7) by the Kronheimer construction. Last but not least one wonders whether the conjecture 3.4.1 applies in the non abelian cases and in particular in the present one of the maximal non abelian finite subgroup of SU(3). The McKay quiver of PSL(2,7) We calculate the McKay matrix defined by Q⊗Di = 6M j=1 Ai j Dj (6.3.19) where Q is the three-dimensional complex representation defining the action of PSL(2,7) on C3 while Di denote the 6 irreducible representation ordered in the standard way we have so far adopted, namely: Di = \b D1,D6,D7,D8,D3,D3 \t (6.3.20) We find the following matrix: A =   0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0   (6.3.21) The matrix A admits the graphical representation displayed in fig.6.2, named the McKay quiver of the quotient C3/PSL(2,7) Therefore for a stack of N branes at the resolved singular point, the gauge-group has the following structure: FPSL(2,7) = S[U(8N)×U(7N)×U(6N)×UA(3N)×UB(3N)×U(N)] (6.3.22) The quiver diagram provides the representation assignments of the 3 ×168 scalar multiplets of the theory. Each line of the diagram is a scalar multiplet in the bi-fundamental representation of the two gauge groups, that in the start node and that in the arrival node. 6.3.3 The case of the maximal subgroup Γ = G21 ⊂ PSL(2,7) Another interesting example, with a somewhat reduced dimensionality which offers the possibility of investi- gating with more ease the same basic questions outlined above, is provided by the maximal subgroup G 21 ⊂ PSL(2,7). In order to obtain the ages for the conjugacy classes of the maximal subgroup G 21, we just need to obtain the explicit three-dimensional form of its generators X and Y satisfying the defining relations: X 3 = Y 7 = 1 ; X Y= Y 2X (6.3.23) This latter is determined by the above explicit form of the PSL (2,7) generators, by recalling the embedding relations: Y = ρ σ τ3 σ ρ ; X = σ ρ σ ρ τ2 (6.3.24) 159U(8N) U(6N) U(7N)U(7N) UA(3N) UB(3N) U(N) Figure 6.2: The quiver diagram of the finite group PSL (2,7) ⊂ SU(3) In this way we obtain the following explicit result: Y → Y =   −(−1)3/7 0 0 0 (−1)6/7 0 0 0 −(−1)5/7   Y → X =   0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0   (6.3.25) 160Hence, for the action on C3 of the maximal subgroup G 21 ⊂ PSL(2,7) we obtain the following ages of its conjugacy classes: Conjugacy Class of G21 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 representative of the class e Y X 2Y X Y2 Y X2 X order of the elements in the class 1 7 7 3 3 age 0 2 1 1 1 number of elements in the class 1 3 3 7 7 (6.3.26) According with the general results discussed in [17], reviewed in section 2.3.2, the resolved manifold Mζ|G21 must have the following Hodge numbers: h(1,1) \u0000 Mζ|G21 \u0001 = 3 ; h(2,2) \u0000 Mζ|G21 \u0001 = 1 (6.3.27) and by Poincar ´e duality we conclude that the exceptional divisor has three components, two non compact and one compact, whose geometry has to be derived. We are therefore in the same situation as that of the maximal subgroup PSL(2,7), namely we expect that in generic points of the chambers, away from the walls we should have: ζζζ = generic : Mζζζ|G21 = L \u0000 MB|G21 \u0001 π− →MB|G21 ∀p ∈ MB|G21 π−1(p) ∼ C (6.3.28) Once again all the questions raised in relation with the manifoldMB|PSL(2,7) apply also to the exceptional divisor MB|G21 and are equally unanswered. The McKay quiver of G21 We calculate the McKay matrix defined by Q⊗Di = 5M j=1 Ai j Dj (6.3.29) where Q is the three-dimensional complex representation defining the action of G 21 on C3 while Di denote the 5 irreducible representations ordered in the standard way we have adopted, namely: Di = \b D0,D1,D1,D3,D3 \t (6.3.30) We find the following matrix: A =   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1   (6.3.31) The matrix A admits the graphical representation presented in fig. 6.3, named the McKay quiver of the quotient C3/G21. From the diagram we immediately read off the gauge group of the corresponding gauge theory and all the representation assignments of the scalar multiplets represented by the various directed lines, whose total number is N ×63 = N ×3× |G21 | 161UA(N) UB(N) UC(N) UD(3N) UF(3N) Figure 6.3: The quiver diagram of the finite group G 21 ⊂ PSL(2,7). In this non-abelian case the corresponding gauge theory has three U(N) factors and two U(3N) factors in its gauge group. 6.3.4 The case of the two maximal octahedral subgroups In order to appreciate the relevance of the two previous cases I review also the case of the other two maximal subgroups of PSL (2,7), namely O 24A and O24B that are both isomorphic to the symmetric group S4 but not conjugate to each other inside the father group PSL (2,7). The age grading of their conjugacy classes was calculated in [17] starting from the two embedding conditions of the generators S and T , satisfying the defining relations: S2 = T 3 = (ST )4 = 1 (6.3.32) Subgroup O24A T = ρ σ ρ τ2 σ ρ τ ; S = τ2 σ ρ τ σ2 (6.3.33) Subgroup O24B T = ρ τ σ ρ τ2 σ ρ τ ; S = σ ρ τ σ ρ τ (6.3.34) 162In this way in [17] the following result was obtained: Conjugacy Class of the O24A C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 representative of the class e T ST ST S ST order of the elements in the class 1 3 2 2 4 age 0 1 1 1 1 number of elements in the class 1 8 3 6 6 (6.3.35) and Conjugacy Class of the O24B C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 representative of the class e T ST ST S ST order of the elements in the class 1 3 2 2 4 age 0 1 1 1 1 number of elements in the class 1 8 3 6 6 (6.3.36) Hence in both cases the exceptional divisor of the resolution has no compact components, so that the picture of eqn. (6.3.18),(6.3.28) does not apply. A feeling of what actually happens is obtained by inspecting the simpler case of the subgroup Z3 ⊂ PSL(2,7) also analyzed in [17]. 6.3.5 The case of the cyclic subgroups Z3 and Z7 We consider the age grading for the quotient singularities C3/Z3 and C3/Z7. As generators of the two cyclic groups we respectively choose the matrices X and Y displayed in eqn. (6.3.25). In other words we utilize either one of the two generators of the maximal subgroup G21 ⊂ PSL(2,7). The Γ = Z3 case. The first step consists of diagonalizing the action of the generator X. Introducing the unitary matrix: q =   1√ 3 1√ 3 1√ 3 −1+i √ 3 2 √ 3 −1−i √ 3 2 √ 3 1√ 3 −1−i √ 3 2 √ 3 −1+i √ 3 2 √ 3 1√ 3   (6.3.37) we obtain: eX ≡ q† Xq =   e 2iπ 3 0 0 0 e−2iπ 3 0 0 0 1   (6.3.38) This shows that the quotient singularityC3/Z3 is actually of the formC2/Z3 ×C since it suffices to change basis of C3 by introducing the new complex coordinates: eza = q b a zb (6.3.39) It follows that in the resolution of the singularity we will obtain: ALEZ3 ×C → C3 Z3 (6.3.40) 163Yet, the starting setup C3/Γ produces a special type of ALE-manifold where all the holomorphic moment map levels are frozen to zero and only the K ¨ahler quotient parameters are switched on. As I claimed above this par- ticularly simple situation illustrates the general situation of what happens in the case that no compact component of the exceptional divisor is present. Each non compact component is probably reducible to a copy of C times the base manifold of a line-bundle over a complex surface Σ like it is the case of ALE manifolds. For instance the simplest ALE, namely the Eguchi Hanson manifold is the total space of the cotangent bundle of the sphere P1. Eq. (6.3.38) corresponds also to the decomposition of the three-dimensional representation of Z3 into irre- ducible representations of Z3. From the diagonalized form (6.3.38) of the generator we immediately obtain the ages of the conjugacy classes: Conjugacy Class of Z3 C1 C2 C3 representative of the class e X X2 order of the elements in the class 1 3 3 age 0 1 1 number of elements in the class 1 1 1 (6.3.41) The above result shows that we have only junior classes and hence no compact component of the exceptional divisor. The Γ = Z7 case. In the Z7 case, the generator Y is already diagonal and, as we see, none of the three complex coordinates is invariant under the action of the group. Hence differently from the previous case we obtain: MZ7 → C3 Z7 (6.3.42) where the resolved smooth manifold is not the direct product of C with an ALE-manifold: MZ7 ̸= ALEZ7 ×C (6.3.43) From the explicit diagonal form (6.3.25) of the generator we immediately obtain the ages of the conjugacy classes: Conjugacy Class of Z7 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 representative of the class e Y Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 Y6 order of the elements in the class 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 age 0 2 2 1 2 1 1 number of elements in the class 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (6.3.44) In this case since we have three junior classes and three senior classes, the exceptional divisor is made out of three compact components, non compact components being absent. The McKay quiver for Z7 In [17] the McKay matrix for the case where Q is the three-dimensional represen- tation of the group Z7 generated by Y as given in eqn. (6.3.25) andDi are the seven irreducible one-dimensional 164Figure 6.4: The quiver diagram of the finite group Z7 ⊂ PSL(2,7). The seven vertices correspond to the seven irreducible representations, 1, marked 0, and ψ,..., ψ6, marked 1,2,..., 6, where ψ is a primitive seventh root of the unity. In each vertex converge three lines and three lines depart from each vertex. representations of Z7 was calculated. The result is displayed below. Q⊗Di = 7M j=1 Ai j Dj (6.3.45) Ai j =   0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0   (6.3.46) The McKay matrix in eqn. (6.3.46) admits the graphical representation of fig.6.4. 165Open questions and comments . The explicit geometry of the compact exceptional divisor is not clear at the moment. An in depth study of this question is certainly necessary in order to understand how the three compact components make up a single compact manifold of complex dimension two or, equivalently of real dimension 4. What one can speculate a priori is that being composed of three separate parts the compact exceptional divisor MB|Z7 , although toric, inherits from the Kronheimer construction a K ¨ahler metric with a limited number of isometries, probably only two. Deriving both the algebraic geometry characterization of this manifold and its Kronheimer metric (if possible) is an important question. 6.3.6 G48: a challenging alternative for the group Γ So far I have considered finite subgroups Γ of SU(3) that are in the embedding chain: Γ ⊂ PSL(2,7) ⊂ SU(3) (6.3.47) yet there are others that are not contained in the maximal subgroup PSL(2,7). One of them has recently attracted my attention since it contains two Z4 subgroups and since it displays just one senior class. These facts point in the direction of the existence of a unique interesting compact exceptional divisor that might be connected with the Hirzebruch surfaces and which might also inherit a K¨ahler metric endowed with a number of isometries larger than the minimal two. This group of order 48 that we name GS48 is generated by the following two matrices: A =   i 0 0 0 −i 0 0 0 1   ; S =   0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0   (6.3.48) That satisfy the following relations: A4 = S3 = (A ·S)3 = (S ·A)3 = e (6.3.49) where e is the neutral element. The generator A is the same as in eqn. (4.1.1) and therefore the Z4 group studied in chapter 4 is a subgroup of the here considered G 48. The number of inequivalent words written with the two letters A,S turns out to be indeed 48 and the resulting group is organized into 8 conjugacy classesCi (i = 0,..., 7) whose populations and order are as follows: C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 # of elements in the class 1 3 3 3 3 3 16 16 order 1 2 4 4 4 4 3 3 (6.3.50) The group G48 contains a normal subgroup N16 that is isomorphic to Z4 ×Z4: Z4 ×Z4 ∼ N16 \u0001 G48 ; G48 N16 ∼ Z3 (6.3.51) Hence following the general procedure for the construction of irreducible representations of solvable groups (see for instance [37]) we conclude that the only irreducible representations of this group G 48 can be either 1-dimensional or three dimensional. Hence from numerology we immediately deduce that the 8 irreducible representations are necessarily so distributed: three one-dimensional representations and five three dimensional ones. The construction is straightforward yet laborious, so it has not yet been done. Consequently I cannot write 166the McKay matrix and diagram at this stage, yet I have calculated the age grading and I have found what follows: C age grading age vector 0 age = 0 identity 1{0,0,0} 1 age = 1 junior 1 2 {1,1,0} 2 age = 2 senior 1 4 {2,3,3} 3 age = 1 junior 1 4 {2,1,1} 4 age = 1 junior 1 4 {1,3,0} 5 age = 1 junior 1 4 {1,3,0} 6 age = 1 junior 1 3 {0,2,1} 7 age = 1 junior 1 3 {0,2,1} (6.3.52) Speculations Clearly there is only one compact component of the exceptional divisor and it is that associated with junior third class. The age vector suggests that just as in the case of Z4 quotient there should be a partial resolution in the form of the canonical bundle on the weighted projective spaceWP[1,1,2]. In the case of theC3/Z4 quotient introducing the resolution associated with the remaining junior class that generates a non compact component of the exceptional divisor, turns the compact divisorWP[1,1,2] into the second Hirzebruch surface F2. Here the remaining junior classes are five and the question is what will emerge in place ofF2? Furthermore what will be the K ¨ahler metric on this compact exceptional divisor? Such questions have to be studied in order to enlarge the spectrum of case studies and unveil the hidden mechanisms behind the resolutions and the Ricci flat metrics on the resolved 6-dimensional spaces transverse to the D3 brane. 167Bibliography [1] P.

This paper  introduces PICS (Pipeline for Image Captioning and Search), a novel approach designed  to address the  complexities inherent in organizing large -scale image repositories. PICS leverages the advancements in  Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the process of image captioning, offering a solution that  transcends traditional manual annotati on methods. The approach is rooted in the understanding that  meaningful, AI-generated captions can significantly enhance the searchability and accessibility of images  in large databases. By integrating sentiment analysis into the pipeline, PICS further enriches the metadata,  enabling nuanced searches that extend beyond basic descriptors. This methodology not only simplifies the  task of managing vast image collections but also sets a new precedent for accuracy and efficiency in image  retrieval. The significance of PICS lies in its potential to transform image database systems, harnessing the  power of machine learning and natural language processing to meet the demands of modern digital asset  management.  KEYWORDS  Image Captioning, Database Management, Large Language Models (LLMs), Image Retrieval  1. INTRODUCTION  Digital images are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our current age of tech devices, such as  smartphones, computers, home security systems, smartwatches, etc., most of which contain some  sort of camera. With this rise in actual image data, not to mention the rise in artificially generated  image data from Vision-Language Models which are able to gen erate high-quality images from  text, it ’s becoming increasingly important to store and organize image data in an efficient ,  repeatable way while also making sure the images are easily accessible. Achieving accurate image  retrieval from a stored database presents many challenges due to the system needing to understand  the details of the image in a way that is relevant to humans [Vijayaraju, Nivetha, 2019].   The concept of differentiating between the human interpretation of the image and what a computer  algorithm can understand from pixel data is known as the semantic gap and bridging it is key to  ensuring image retrieval systems can understand and respond to human queries [Kwaśnicka et al.,  2018]. Additionally, image variation regarding lighting, perspective, occlusion, and quality also  presents another significant challenge that can affect the performance of these systems making it  important to create algorithms robust enough to handle these differing image styles [Jenicek et  al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020 ]. Another crucial challenge in image ret rieval involves the  standardization of annotations and metadata in which image metadata can frequently be  incomplete, inconsistent, or absent altogether [Wang et al., 2009]. Lastly, integrating contextual  information which goes beyond the actual image content , such as geographical data, temporal  information, or in our case sentiment descriptors continues to be a pervasive challenge [Krojer et  al, 2022]. Ultimately, image retrieval systems continue to attempt to solve these problems in order  to balance accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in diverse real-world applications. Table 1: Left: Images in sentiment dataset. Right: Name of corresponding image.    For the present work, we ’re introducing PICS, or “Pipeline for Image Captioning and Search ”,  which seeks to address some of the se challenges. In our implementation , we are utili zing the  Image Sentiment Analysis dataset since it provides a large enough and contextually rich dataset  of images as well as descriptive annotations we can attach for image retrieval [Hassan et al.,  2022]. The novel steps of our pipeline consist of first addressing the naming convention issue of  many image datas ets. As shown in Table 1, most image datasets consist of  either randomly  generated image names or research-specific conventions that have no meaning to end users. The  first step in PICS is to rename the images based on LLaVA and Mistral 7B by giving it a specific  prompt and letting the model generate descriptive captions based on the image content [Liu et al.,  2023; Jiang et al., 2023].  Secondly, we match the images to their corresponding human-generated  sentiment annotations and add these annotations as metadata to each image. We then add these   images to a database for image retrieval resulting in a database that  we believe improves the  current balance of Machine L earning based visual descriptions with diverse human-generated  contextual annotations.     Figure 1: Concept-Based Image Indexing Workflow [Baeldung]        00afad9b-78f7-48d6-a44b-b046019a4548.jpg        00bf1649-7f48-44ce-b208-a648023bd65a.jpg        00c9dbac-4f02-4bdb-abf6-9dae2f4b8fc6.jpg        00c8305c-c779-4445-b3d6-ecfbce875ed5.jpg    2. RELATED WORK  When it comes to image retrieval, there are two industry standard methods used today; Concept- Based Image Indexing and Content-Based Image Retreival [Chu et al., 2001; Ibtihaal et al., 2021].  2.1. Concept-Based Image Indexing  Sometimes referred to as text-based image retrieval, this method relies on indexing and retrieving  images based on abstract concepts and semantics, typically provided by human labelers. Figure 1  shows the data and workflow structure of this method in action. The database manager populates  the database with images and their corresponding textual annotations, labels, tags, etc., and the  user can retrieve images by querying certain keywords, annotations, or descriptions that  correspond with the residing labels. Concept-based image indexing returns any images that were  assigned similar textual tags as what the user specified [Chu et al., 2001].   Early research in  concept-based image indexing primarily focused on associating descriptive  keywords or tags with images, either through manual annotation or using basic object recognition  techniques. The breakthroughs in this period allowed users to search for images based on textual  queries that matched these annotations. However, manually annotating images was and is labor- intensive and lacks scalability [Smeulders et al., 2000].  Later research sought to address the drawbacks of manual annotation by automating the workflow  using unsupervised clustering methods [Jeon et al., 2003]. This was a promising step forward but  many attempts at automation still required a base foundation of annotated images. However with  the advent of machine learni ng and s pecifically the development of Convolutional Neural  Networks (CNNs) made significant stride in the ease of labelling [Krizhevsky et al., 2012]. This  paved the way for more sophisticated concept-based image indexing systems capable of  understanding and categorizing image content at a near-human level.  Most recently, the field continues to evolve with research delving into more nuanced aspects of  image understanding , such as sentiment analysi s, applying experimental deep learning  architectures, and utilizing LLMs to perform large scale image retrieval [Hongbin et al., 2022 ;  Noh et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2022].      Figure 2: CBIR system schema [wikipedia]     2.2. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)    Content-based image retrieval ( CBIR) referse to the process of retrieving relevant images from  large databases based on the content present within them, such as colors, textures, shapes, or any  other information that can be derived from the image itself. Figure 2 illustrates the typical schema  of a CBIR system. The main obvious different from concept-based image indexing is that the user  is making a request by providing a source image and asking for similar images rather than making  a request based on text. The system then comapres the content of the query image with the conent  of the database images. This makes this method unique in that it isn’t reliant on manual annotation  and text -based searching. CBIR systems aim to analyze and un derstand the visual content of  images directly, which ideally allows for more intuitive and effective image searching [Smeulders  et al., 2000].     Recent research in the field of CBIR has more or less surpassed the performance of concept-based  image indexing . The advent of m achine learning coupled with computer vision techniques  enabled CBIR systems to visually understand images and significant components of them in ways  strikingly similar to humans [Datta et al., 2008].      2. METHODS  The pipeline we’re introducing, PICS, provides a unique outlook on the current image retrieval  trends in that it combines some aspects of both concept-based image indexing and content-based  image retrieval. As stated previously, to conduct our experiment, we are using the Sentiment   Analysis dataset due to it already containing a rich annotation dataset that corresponds with the  images as well as contextually rich images that a Large Vision Model can potentially add more  descriptive labels to.         8c1aa7ed-1c6a-4cf2-8fas- d4a8dbbfdd3e.jpg      Prompt: The best description of  the image in ten words or less  is…      Fireman_with_hose_in_front _of_fire.jpg  Table 2: LLaVa prompt example. Left: Original image and name. Middle: LLaVa Prompt. Right:  Resulting new image name/caption combo    3.1. CBIR step  The first issue our pipeline addresses is the image naming convention problem. Most images that  exist in datasets today are labelled with random conventions unknown to the end user,  thereby  causing a gap in the image data where there could be beneficial information. Our pipeline presents  a solution to this problem by using a content -based machine learning approach. We begin by  utilizing a bash script and llamafiles which enable users to turn a Large Language Models (LLMs)  weights into executables, thereby enabling users to prompt LLMs just like they would an  executable [Hood 2023; Tunney 2024]. The first step in this script is to use Mistral-7B to look at  the image name and decide if it is already in readbale English or consists of non-readable letters,  numbers, and/or symbols. If it is non-readable, we prompt the LLaVA Large Language and Vision  Assistant llamafile to generate a new title for the image based on the content of the image itself.  Table 2 shows the prompt we used and an example result. It’s important to note that we save the  original non-readable image name in the image metadata so that it’s accessible when we need to  look up the corresponding sentiment annotations.    3.2. Concept-based step  With this CBIR-like step done, our next step is taking the sentiment annotation extraction. This  is what we would call the concept-based indexing step. We simply grab the o riginal name from  the image meta data and look up  the corresponding sentiment ann otation. Once we obtain the   relevant sentiment tags based on the hum an-labeled sentiment annotations, we add these to the  images as new metadata.      Figure 3: PICS \"Pipeline for Image Caption and Search\"      3.3. Database Creation  Lastly, we simply create a database with ou r image file paths, image names, and sentiment  annotations. Figure 3 il lustrates our schema  workflow for PICS  while kee ping the source  annotations agnostic, while we used sentiment annotations, any reliable annotat ions could be  used.    3. RESULTS  The results of PICS provide a promisi ng lookup relevance and accuracy. As  shown in Table 3,  typing in a keyword like happy and animal returns two highly relevant images to our search terms.  We believe the most beneficial piece of PICS is the integration with current Large Vision Models.  These models provide new avenues for creating highly accurate and relevant captions and image  names in fraction of the time it would take human labelers to accomplish the same task.      Search: Animal, happy    a_small_brown_animal_sitting_in_tall_ grass.jpg      dry_land_with_animals _and_people_on_it.jpg      4. DISCUSSION  We believe the PICS (Pipeline for Image Caption and Search) system represent a significant stride  in automating the process of image annotation and retrieval. By integrating the capabilities of  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaVa and Mistral -7B, alongside human -generated  labels from a sentiment analysis dataset, PICS has showcased the potential to substantially reduce  the time and labor traditionally required for accurate image annotation and captioning. The usage  of LLaVa and Mistral-7B has proven particularly promising, as these models not only understand  the contextual nuances in images but also translate these perceptions into coherent and descriptive  captions. This combination of perception and linguistic generation is what sets PICS apart from  earlier systems that relied solely on fixed databases of keywords or ML-based pattern recognition.  An unforeseen advantage of PICS is its ability to process images at a speed that far surpasses  manual labeling. The implications of this are multifold; it enables the rapid categorization of large  datasets, facilitates the dynamic updating of image libraries, and supports real -time image  retrieval applications.  However, the PICS system is not without its challenges. One of the primary concerns is the  reliance on the quality and diversity of  the training data used for the LLMs. Biases inherent in  training datasets can lead to skewed or inaccurate captions, which necessitates careful curation of  the training material. Additionally, the semantic gap —while narrowed —is still present. The  current system excels in general contexts but may struggle with highly specialized or nuanced  imagery that requires expert knowledge.  Looking forward, the integration of PICS with feedback loops where human inputs refine and  correct the system's outputs could establish a synergistic relationship between AI -generated and  human-generated annotations. This collaboration could lead to contin uous improvement in the  accuracy and relevance of the captions, while still retaining the efficiency of an automated system.

To test the accuracy of published limb-darkening models, I have compared limb-darkening proﬁles predicted by stellar atmosphere models to the limb-darkening proﬁles measured from high-quality light curves of 43 FGK-type stars in transiting exoplanet systems observed by the Kepler and TESS missions. The comparison is done using the parameters ℎ0 1 =𝐼𝜆¹23ºand ℎ0 2 =ℎ0 1 \u0000𝐼𝜆¹13º, where𝐼𝜆¹𝜇ºis the speciﬁc intensity emitted in the direction𝜇, the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the surface normal vector. These parameters are straightforward to interpret and insensitive to the details of how they are computed. I ﬁnd that most (but not all) tabulations of limb-darkening data agree well with the observed values ofℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2. There is a small but signiﬁcant oﬀsetΔℎ0 1 \u00190006 compared to the observed values that can be ascribed to the eﬀect of a mean vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength\u0019100 G that is expected in the photospheres of these inactive solar-type stars but that is not accounted for by typical stellar model atmospheres.

For a spherical star,𝜇 = p 1 \u0000𝑟2, where 𝑟 is the radial coordinate on the stellar disc from𝑟 = 0 at the centre to𝑟 =1 at the limb. Models of eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanets typically use limb-darkening laws that assume 𝐼𝜆¹1º=1. This normalisation is assumed implicitly throughout this paper. The advent of very high precision photometry for transiting exo- planet systems has led to extensive discussion in the literature of the systematic errors in the parameters for these exoplanet systems that result from inaccuracies and uncertainties in the treatment of limb darkening, e.g. Csizmadia et al. (2013), Espinoza & Jordán (2016), Müller et al. (2013), Howarth (2011), Sing et al. (2008), Morello et al. (2017), Neilson et al. (2017), Kipping (2013), Patel & Es- pinoza (2022), etc. One well-established result from such studies is thatusingalinearlimbdarkeninglaw, 𝐼𝜆¹𝜇º=1\u0000𝑥¹1\u0000𝜇º,canlead tosigniﬁcantbiasintheparametersderivedfromtheanalysisofhigh quality photometry.

Among the limb-darkening laws with two coeﬃcients, the power- 2 limb-darkening law (Hestroﬀer 1997) has been recommended by Morello et al. (2017) as they ﬁnd that it outperforms other two- coeﬃcient laws adopted in the exoplanet literature in most cases, particularly for cool stars. The form of this limb-darkening law is 𝐼𝜆¹𝜇º=1 \u0000𝑐\u00001 \u0000𝜇𝛼\u0001  (2) In Maxted (2018) I used this limb-darkening law to analyse high- qualitylightcurvesfor16solar-typestarswithtransitinghot-Jupiter © 2022 The Authors arXiv:2212.09117v1  [astro-ph.EP]  18 Dec 20222 P.

I found that the parameters𝑐 and 𝛼 are strongly cor- related with one another so, to compare these results to the limb- darkening proﬁles from stellar atmosphere models, I introduced the parameters ℎ1 = 𝐼𝜆¹12º=1 \u0000𝑐¹1 \u00002\u0000𝛼º ℎ2 = ℎ1 \u0000𝐼𝜆¹0º=𝑐2\u0000𝛼 (3) These parameters were found to be uncorrelated and so could be use to deﬁne useful priors for a Bayesian analysis of a light curve for an eclipsing binary star or transiting exoplanet for solar-type stars using the power-2 limb-darkening law. Short et al. (2019) note that the range of validℎ1 and ℎ2 values given in Maxted (2018) is incorrect. They provide equations to calculate the transformed parameters 0  𝑞1  1 and 0  𝑞2  1 that span the full range of valid ℎ1 and ℎ2 values. The deﬁnition ofℎ2 causes problems if we want to apply the re- sults from Maxted (2018) to other limb-darkening laws, or to test the accuracy of limb-darkening laws computed with model stellar atmospheres. One problem is the deﬁnition of the radius for limb- darkening proﬁles computed with spherically-symmetric model at- mospheres. One such proﬁle is shown in Fig. 1. These models can reproduce the smooth, sharp drop in ﬂux near the limb of the star thatisexpectedforsolar-typestarsbasedonobservationsofthesolar limb-darkening proﬁle. This drop in ﬂux near the limb is not seen in 1-dplane-parallelmodelatmospheres.3-dradiativehydrodynamical modelsarecomputedonagridofﬁnitesize,soitisdiﬃculttocom- putethedropinﬂuxatlargevaluesof 𝜃usingthesesimulations.The detailed shape of the drop in ﬂux near the limb has a negligible im- pactontheobservedlightcurvesforsolar-typestars,butitdoesmake the deﬁnition ofℎ2 ambiguous. This complicates the interpretation of ℎ2 values inferred from light curve analysis. In this study, I have used the Claret 4-parameter limb-darkening law (Claret 2000) to analyse high-quality light curves for sample of transiting hot-Jupiter systems. This limb-darkening law uses four coeﬃcientstocapturethedetailedshapeofthelimb-darkeningproﬁle using the following equation – 𝐼𝜆¹𝜇º=1 \u0000 4∑︁ 𝑗=1 𝑎𝑗¹1 \u0000𝜇𝑗2º (4) I introduce two new parameters,ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2, that can be unambigu- ously computed for any limb-darkening proﬁle. In Section 2 I use simulations to show that the values ofℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 measured from light curves are directly related to the true limb-darkening proﬁle of the star, and so can be used directly to compare the limb-darkening proﬁles recovered from the observed light curves to limb-darkening calculated with stellar model atmospheres. Section 3 describes the methods used to analyse the observed light curves for a sample of transiting hot-Jupiter systems, and present the results of this analy- sis. Section 4 compares these results to previous studies, and to the predictions from a selection of stellar atmosphere models. Section 5 contains my conclusions and recommendations for how to use these resultstoconstrainlimb-darkeningintheanalysisoflightcurvesfor eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems. 2 LIGHT CURVE SIMULATIONS To better understand the constraints on stellar limb darkening pro- vided by the light curves of transiting exoplanets, I used simulations based on the solar limb-darkening proﬁle computed by Kostogryz etal.(2022).Thissemi-empiricallimb-darkeningproﬁleusesacom- bination of observations and model spectra to produce a realistic set of intensity spectra as a function of wavelength and viewing angle. The spectra are computed at the same values of𝜇 (20 values from 0.01 to 1) for which observed values of the centre-to-limb variation of the Sun are provided by Neckel & Labs (1994), sampled at 7000 wavelength values from 339nm to 1087nm. I used these spectra to compute the limb-darkening proﬁle of a Sun-like star in theKepler bandpass1 by numerical integration of the intensity spectra over the instrument response function, including a factorℎ𝑐𝜆to account for the fact that theKepler instrument used photon-counting detectors. The 20 values of𝐼Kp ¹𝜇ºobtained were then scaled by a constant so that 𝐼Kp ¹1º=1. I usedbatman version 2.4.7 (Kreidberg 2015) to simulate light curvesoftransitingexoplanetsassumingalimb-darkeningproﬁleof the form 𝐼Kp ¹𝜇º=1 \u0000 6∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝑐𝑖¹1 \u0000𝜇º𝑖 (5) The coeﬃcients 𝑐1𝑐 6 were computed using a least-squares ﬁt to the 20 values of𝐼Kp ¹𝜇ºdescribed above.

Theseparametersarestronglycorrelatedwithoneanother,whichcan be problematic for many least-squares optimisation algorithms. To quantify these correlations I used the aﬃne-invariant Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampleremcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013; Good- man & Weare 2010) to sample the posterior probability distribution of these parameters for the least-squares ﬁt to one simulated light curve. I then used principal component analysis (PCA) as imple- mented inscikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to ﬁnd a linear transformation between the free parameters of the model and seven uncorrelated variables 𝑝1 𝑝 7. To ﬁnd the best ﬁt to each sim- ulated light curve I used the Nelder-Meade algorithm implemented in scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020) with the simplex deﬁned in the transformed parameter space𝑝1 𝑝 7. For every trial set of limb- darkening coeﬃcients, 𝑎1𝑎 4, the limb-darkening proﬁle was computed at 100 uniformly-distributed values of𝜇 from 0.01 to 1. Solutions where these coeﬃcients do not correspond to a physically realistic limb-darkening proﬁle with0  𝐼¹𝜇º 1 and 𝑑𝐼¹𝜇º 𝑑𝜇 ¡ 0 for all values of𝜇were rejected. The limb-darkening proﬁle recovered from one simulated light curvewith 𝑏=04 isshowninFig.2.Thelimb-darkeningproﬁlesfor other values of𝑏 \u001906 are qualitatively similar. It is clear from this ﬁgure that the simulated light curve contains very little information about the limb-darkening proﬁle of the star for𝜇\u001902, i.e. near the limb of the star. This may seem to be at odds with the results from Maxted (2018) where values ofℎ2 = 𝐼Kp ¹12º\u0000 𝐼Kp ¹0ºare quoted with a typical accuracy of about\u0006005. However, those results were based on least-squares ﬁts toKepler light curves of transiting hot Figure3.

The implication of Fig. 2 is that the parameterℎ2 is determined by the limb darkening proﬁle at 𝜇 ¡\u001902, even though it is deﬁned in terms of𝐼Kp ¹0º. So, as well as being ambiguously deﬁned, the deﬁnition ofℎ2 is also misleading, in that it does not measure what claims to measure. The value of ℎ2 will also be subject to systematic error if the true limb-darkening proﬁle does not closely match the assumed limb-darkening law near the limb of the star. MNRAS000, 1–13 (2022)4 P.

Fig. 3 also shows thatℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 are not stronglycorrelatedfortransitimpactparametervalues 𝑏 \u0019065.For 𝑏 ¡\u0019065, ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 are strongly correlated because the light curve does not contain enough information to determine these parameters independently. One further conclusion we can take from Fig. 3 is that the standard error estimates onℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 based in the PPD sampled withemcee are accurate for a light curve with uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Fig. 4 shows how a small change in the value ofℎ0 1 or ℎ0 2 changes the shape of the light curve for a typical transiting hot-Jupiter system. I used simulations similar to those described above to verify that the values of ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 obtained by ﬁtting a transit light curve are insensitive to “third light” (contamination of the light curve by an unresolved companion star or other light source) provided the contamination is less than about 5per cent.

The normalised ﬂuxes from each quarter were then combined into a single phase-binned light curve in two steps. I ﬁrst calculated the median value in phase bins of width 180s. I then rejected points 4 https://docs.lightkurve.org/ more than 5 times the mean absolute deviation in each phase bin from the analysis. The remaining points were then used to calculate themeanandstandarderrorofthemeaninphasebinsofwidth60s. Thetimevalueassignedtoeachphasebincorrespondstoatimenear themiddleofthequarteratthesameorbitalphaseasthemeanphase of the points in the bin. This allows me to include the orbital period as a free parameter in the ﬁt to the data from all quarters. For theTESS data I used the same steps as for theKepler data to normalize the ﬂuxes and identify outliers. There is, in general, less data available for these targets so I do not phase-bin the data prior to further analysis. The error assigned to each data point is taken to be 1.25 times the mean absolute deviation of points in the same phase bin so that regions of the light curve that show excess noise are appropriately down-weighted in the analysis. A phase bin width of 120s was used for all these calculations. 3.3 Transit model ﬁts To model the transits in the light curves of the selected stars I used batman version 2.4.7 (Kreidberg 2015) with Claret’s 4-parameter non-linear limb-darkening law. For theTESSdata I used 3-point nu- mericalintegrationtoaccountfortheexposuretimeof120s.Thefree parameters in the ﬁt were: orbital period,𝑃; time of mid-transit,𝑇0; planet-starradiusratio, 𝑘 =𝑅pl𝑅★;hoststarradiusrelativetotheor- bitalsemi-majoraxis, 𝑅★𝑎;transitimpactparameter 𝑏=𝑎cos 𝑖𝑅★ (where 𝑖 is the planet’s orbital inclination); and the limb-darkening coeﬃcients, 𝑎1𝑎 4. For systems where I found an independent measurement of the orbital eccentricity that is signiﬁcantly diﬀer- ent from 𝑒 = 0, I also include𝑒 and 𝜔 (the longitude of perias- tron) as free parameters but with Gaussian priors applied so that they remain consistent with the independently-measured values. For every trial set of limb-darkening coeﬃcients,𝑎1𝑎 4, the limb- darkening proﬁle was computed at 100 uniformly-distributed values of 𝜇 from 0.01 to 1. This calculation was used to reject solutions where these coeﬃcients do not correspond to a physically realistic limb-darkening proﬁle, i.e.0  𝐼¹𝜇º  1 and 𝑑𝐼¹𝜇º 𝑑𝜇 ¡ 0 for all values of𝜇. To sample the posterior probability distribution (PPD) for the vector of model parameters𝜽 given the observed light curve, 𝐷, 𝑃¹𝜽j𝐷º/ 𝑃¹𝐷j𝜽º𝑃¹𝜽ºI used the aﬃne-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo sampleremcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013; Good- man & Weare 2010). To compute the likelihood𝑃¹𝐷j𝜽ºI assume thattheerrorondatapoint 𝑖hasaGaussiandistributionwithstandard deviation 𝑓𝜎𝑖 and that these errors are independent. The logarithm of the error-scaling factor𝑓 is included as a hyper-parameter in the vector of model parameters𝜽. I used uniform priors on all model parameters within the full range allowed by thebatman model. Iused100walkersand1000stepstogeneratearandomsampleof points from the PPD following 4000 “burn-in” steps. Convergence ofthechainwasconﬁrmedbyvisualinspectionofthesamplevalues for each parameter as a function of step number to ensure that there are no trends in the mean values or variances for the sample values from all walkers after the burn-in phase. A typical parameter correlation plot for selected parameters is showninFig.6.Themeanandstandarddeviationfortheparameters of interest calculated from the sampled PPD are summarised in Ta- ble 2. Note that the orbital inclination is allowed to exceed𝑖 = 90\u000e so the PPD may include negative values of𝑏. Examples of the best ﬁts to typicalKepler and TESS light curves are shown in Fig. 7. Also shown in Fig. 7 is the ﬁt to the light curve of Kepler-17, a star that shows a moderate level of magnetic activity, resulting in excess scatterthroughthetransit.TomeasurethisexcessscatterIcomputed MNRAS000, 1–13 (2022)6 P.

I also analysed all the light curves using the polynomial limb- darkening law given in equation 5. The coeﬃcients𝑐5 and 𝑐6 were both ﬁxed to0 but the other 4 coeﬃcients were included as free pa- rameters in the ﬁt. The details of the analysis are otherwise identical to those described above. The results are almost identical to those obtained using Claret’s 4-parameter limb-darkening so are not re- portedhere.Thisdoesdemonstratethattheconclusionsofthisstudy are not aﬀected by the choice of limb-darkening law used to analyse the light curves. 3.4 Notes on individual objects 3.4.1 Kepler-6 A correction for a small amount of third light,ℓ3 =0033, reported by Dunham et al.

The agreement between the values ofℎ0 1 from these two studies is excellent (Δℎ0 1 = 0000 \u00060008, 𝜎ext1 =0001).

The implication of these results is that the measured values ofℎ0 1 are robust but the values ofℎ0 2 may be aﬀected by systematic errors\u0019001 depending on the details of the analysis. 4.3 Comparison to limb-darkening proﬁles from models 4.3.1 Technical details For each set of tabulated limb-darkening coeﬃcients, the predicted valuesof ℎ0 1 andℎ0 2 foreachstararecomputedbylinearinterpolation basedonthevaluesof 𝑇eﬀ ,log 𝑔and[Fe/H]giveninTable1.Errors on ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 are computed using a Monte Carlo method assuming Gaussianindependenterrorsontheseinputvalues.Formostmodels, the interpolation yields values of the coeﬃcients𝑎1𝑎 4 that are thenusedtocompute ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 usingequation(4).Forthecompari- sontotheresultsofKostogryzetal.(2022)Iusethetabulatedvalues of 𝐼𝜆¹𝜇ºdirectly with linear interpolation to computeℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2.

For systems with𝑏 065, ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 will be correlated but there are similar numbers of stars with positive and negative values of𝐶¹ℎ0 1ℎ0 2ºso the statistics in Table 3 should be reliable.

The limb-darkening coeﬃcients for PHOENIX-COND models fromClaret(2018)andfromMARCSmodelsbyMorelloetal.(2022) areonlyavailableatsolar-metallicity.Ihaveusedthelimb-darkening coeﬃcientsfromSet1ofKostogryzetal.(2022)tocalculatealinear correction for [Fe/H] to the values ofℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 from these models. The mean values of𝑇eﬀ ,log 𝑔and [Fe/H] for the stars in our sample are h𝑇eﬀ i=6355 K, hlog 𝑔i=439 and h»FeH¼i=023. For these values of𝑇eﬀ and log 𝑔, assuming»FeH¼= 0 results in a value of ℎ0 1 that is 0.0027too high anda value ofℎ0 2 that is 0.0035too low in the TESS band cf. the values obtained assuming»FeH¼=023. In theKeplerband, ℎ0 1 is0.0034toohighand ℎ0 2 is0.0041toolow.This correction for metallicity has a very small inﬂuence on the results presented in Table 3. 4.3.2 Results Apart from the models by Neilson & Lester (2013), the results in Table3arefairlysimilarforallmodels.Typically,thereisasmallbut MNRAS000, 1–13 (2022)TESS and Kepler limb darkening measurements9 Figure 7.

The oﬀsetΔℎ0 2 \u0019\u0000001 typically seen for these models is probably not signiﬁcant because is comparable to the systematic error due to diﬀerences in the analysis methods used discussed in the previous section. Neilson & Lester (2013) found a large diﬀerence in the limb- darkeningproﬁlestheycomputedusingplane-parallel(ATLAS)and spherically-symmetric (sATLAS) model atmospheres. This diﬀer- ence can be seen in Fig. 1. They conclude that “sphericity is impor- tant even for dwarf model atmospheres, leading to signiﬁcant diﬀer- ences in the predicted coeﬃcients”. The PHOENIX-COND models from Claret (2018) also assume spherical symmetry. In contrast to Neilson & Lester, I see very good agreement between the results from the PHOENIX-COND models and plane-parallel models, and goodagreementbetweenthesemodelsandtheobservations.Thereis ratherpooragreementbetweentheobservedvaluesof ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 and thepredictedvaluesfromNeilson&LesterforboththeATLASand Figure8.

No other models show any signiﬁcant trend inΔℎ0 1 or Δℎ0 2 with 𝑇eﬀ . 4.3.4 Impact of magnetic activity In Maxted (2018), I suggested that the small oﬀsets between the ob- served values ofℎ1 and ℎ2 and the values predicted by the Stagger- grid models may be due to weak magnetic ﬁelds in the atmospheres of the solar-type stars studied. None of the atmosphere models dis- cussed here, including the Stagger-grid models, include the impact ofmagneticﬁelds.Thecomparisonofobserved ℎ2 valuestomodels is not straightforward for the reasons discussed above, but the con- clusion regardingℎ1 from Maxted (2018) is robust and very similar to the results forℎ0 1 in this study. The impact of a magnetic ﬁeld on the limb-darkening of the Sun can be seen in Fig. 4 of Norris et al. (2017). This ﬁgure shows the limb-darkeningofaSun-likestarcomputedusingtheMURaMstellar atmosphere model assuming either zero magnetic ﬁeld or including ameanverticalmagneticﬁeldstrengthof100G,whichistypicalfor the quiet Sun. The eﬀect of this magnetic ﬁeld at a wavelength of 611nm is to increaseℎ0 1 by 0.007 and to decreaseℎ0 2 by 0.005. This agreesverywellwiththeobservedvaluesof ℎ0 1 andℎ0 2 observedinthe Kepler bandpass with a mean wavelength\u0019630 nm. The tendency for the magnetic ﬁeld to have less of an eﬀect at redder wavelengths seen in Fig. 4 of Norris et al. is also reﬂected in our results for the TESS bandpass with a mean wavelength\u0019800 nm cf. the results for the bluerKeplerbandpass. An intriguing piece of evidence in favour of this interpretation is the case of WASP-18. This star has a signiﬁcantly lower value ofℎ0 1 comparedtostarswithsimilar 𝑇eﬀ .ThiscanbeseeninFig.10,where WASP-18istheoutlierthatsitsbelowthetrendat 𝑇eﬀ \u00196500 Kand Δℎ0 1 \u0019 0, i.e. models without magnetic ﬁelds do a good job of predicting the limb-darkening for WASP-18. This star is known to have abnormally low level of magnetic activity compared to similar stars of the same age, probably due to the inﬂuence of its massive, very short-period planetary companion (𝑀 = 10 𝑀Jup, 𝑃 = 094 d, Pillitteri et al. 2014; Fossati et al. 2018). Magnetic activity will cause additional scatter in the light curve during the transit due to the variations in the mean ﬂux level outside transit and occultation of active regions by the planet. This can be seen for the case of Kepler-17 in Fig. 7. The quantity𝑟 given in Table3quantiﬁesthisadditionalscatter.Thereisnoclearcorrelation betweenthevaluesof Δℎ0 1 orΔℎ0 2 and𝑟,butthereareonlythreestars with𝑟 ¡12 so it diﬃcult to know how to interpret this result. An anonymous referee has suggested that the stellar atmosphere models used to compute the various limb-darkening tabulations in Table 3 may have been designed to agree with the measurements of the solar limb-darkening by Neckel & Labs (1994). This is not the case for the models by Kostogryz et al., which were tested against the solar data but not calibrated using these data (A. Shapiro, priv. comm.), nor for the MARCS models used by Morello et al. (2022) (B. Plez, priv. comm.). I was unable to ﬁnd any mention of calibra- tion against solar limb-darkening measurements in the papers that describe the models used for the limb-darkening tabulations in Ta- ble 3 (Kurucz 1992; Husser et al. 2013; Lester & Neilson 2008). Even if these models were “tuned” to agree with Neckel & Labs’ measurements, this would not lead to a good ﬁt to the transit light curves of a solar-twin since this light curve would include the eﬀect of the planet crossing spots and faculae on the stellar disc, features thatwerestrictlyexcludedfromthemeasurementsreportedinNeckel & Labs (1994).

However, this study was motivated by the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) International Teams project \"Getting Ultra- PrecisePlanetaryRadiiwithPLATO:TheImpactofLimbDarkening and Stellar Activity on Transit Light Curves\", so it is worthwhile to consider in the light of these results whether uncertainties in limb- darkening models are a signiﬁcant obstacle to the primary aim of the PLATO mission – to measure the radii of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars with a precision of 3per cent (Rauer et al. 2016). I used the PLATO solar-like light-curve simulatorpsls version 1.5 (Samadi et al. 2019) to generate 1000 days of simulated data for a Sun-like star with an apparent magnitude𝑉 = 10 assuming that the star is observed by all 24 cameras. Apart from the apparent magnitude of the star and the time span of the data, all other options were left at the values set in the example input conﬁguration ﬁle psls.yaml providedwiththesoftware.Simulatedtrendsinthedata were removed by dividing the simulated ﬂux values by a smoothed versionofthelightcurveusingaSavitzky-Golayﬁlterwithawindow width of 1 day. ForeachtrialinthisMonteCarloanalysis,Iselectedarandomtime of mid-transit for the ﬁrst transit and assumed that three transits 1 yearapartareobservedconsecutively.Themodeltransitiscalculated assuming that the planet has the same radius and orbital period as the Earth, the transit impact parameter is𝑏=0, the orbit is circular, andthatthestarhasthesamemassandradiusastheSun.Themodel transit was calculated using the methods described in Section 2. A typical simulated light curve is shown in Fig. 11 Toselectalimb-darkeninglawfortheanalysis,Iﬁttedthenoiseless modeltransitlightcurveassumingeitheraquadraticlimb-darkening law, a power-2 limb-darkening law, or the Claret 4-parameter limb- darkening law. I selected the power-2 law since it shows the lowest standarddeviationoftheresidualsofthesethreelimb-darkeninglaws (0.017ppmcf.0.023ppmforthe4-parameterlawand0.106ppmfor the quadratic law). The power-2 law also shows the smallest oﬀset betweentheplanet-starradiusratioderivedfromaleast-squaresﬁtto the noiseless transit light curve and the planet-star radius ratio used tosimulatethetransitlightcurve( \u0000001 percentcf.0.10per-centfor the 4-parameter law and 0.16per cent for the quadratic law). Least-squares ﬁts to each of the simulated light curves were per- formed with Gaussian priors onℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 centred on the values determined from the limb-darkening proﬁle used to simulate the model transit and with standard errors of 0.01 onℎ0 1 and 0.02ℎ0 2. These nominal uncertainties onℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 are based on the results in Table 3 assuming that an empirical correction is applied to the values of these parameters from one of the models that gives accu- ratepredictionsoftheirvalues,butwithsomeuncertaintyduetothe observedscatteraroundthepredictedvaluesandthestandarderrorin the zero-point correction. The free parameters in these least-squares ﬁts are 𝑘 = 𝑅pl𝑅★, 𝑏, 𝑅★𝑎, ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2. I also used a Gaussian prior on the mean stellar density calculated from𝑅★𝑎 and 𝑃 via Kepler’sthirdlawassumingthatthisvalueisknownaccuratelywith aprecisionof1percentfromasterosiesmologyofthehoststar.These MNRAS000, 1–13 (2022)12 P. F. L. Maxted results were compared to the results of similar least-squares ﬁts to the same simulated light curves with the limb-darkening ﬁxed to the best-ﬁt power-2 law to the actual limb-darkening proﬁle. From 10000 Monte Carlo simulations we ﬁnd that the standard error on the planet-star radius ratio with ﬁxed limb-darkening is 2.579per cent whereas with our nominal Gaussian priors onℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 thestandarderrorontheplanet-starradiusratiois2.594percent. This shows that uncertainties on limb-darkening will add approx- imately (0.3per cent)2 to the variance in the measured planet-star radius ratio for Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zones of bright Sun-like stars, i.e. much smaller than the expected error on the measured planet-star ratio for Earth-like planets orbiting bright Sun-like stars. 5 CONCLUSIONS Inthisstudy,Ihavestudiedthelimb-darkeninginformationcontentin theKeplerandTESSlightcurvesforasampleofsolar-typestarswith transiting hot-Jupiter companions. The limb-darkening information isquantiﬁedusingtheparameters ℎ0 1 =𝐼𝜆¹23ºandℎ0 2 =ℎ0 1 \u0000𝐼𝜆¹13º. These parameters are shown to be well-deﬁned and subject to little ornosystematicerror.Theseobservedvaluesof ℎ0 1 andℎ0 2 havebeen comparedtothepredictionsfromseveralgridsofstellaratmosphere models.Ingeneral,theagreementbetweenmodelsandobservations is very good. There is a small but signiﬁcant oﬀsetΔℎ0 1 \u00190006 between the observed and calculated values ofℎ0 1 which can be ascribed to the impact of the magnetic ﬁeld on the atmospheric structure of these solar-type stars. Based on these results, I recommend that any of the following sources can be used to obtain reliable limb-darkening data for solar- type stars with low levels of magnetic activity – Maxted (2018), Kostogryzetal.(2022),Claret&Bloemen(2011),Sing(2010).The performance of all these models is similar and none of them show signiﬁcant trends inΔℎ0 1 or Δℎ0 2 with𝑇eﬀ . The “Set 1” models from Kostogryz et al. (2022) perform particularly well and cover a wide rangeof 𝑇eﬀ ,log 𝑔and[Fe/H]values,andwithgoodsamplingofthis parameter space. However, it should be noted that all these models willshowasmalloﬀsetfromthetruelimb-darkeningproﬁlebecause they do not account for the eﬀects of the mean magnetic ﬁeld on the star’s atmospheric structure. This will introduce a small systematic errorintheparametersobtainedfromtheanalysisofthelightcurveif the limb-darkening proﬁle is ﬁxed in the analysis. A better approach is to include some or all of the limb-darkening coeﬃcients as free parameters in the analysis but with Gaussian priors on the values of ℎ0 1 and ℎ0 2 included in the ﬁt. Forℎ0 1, the mean of the Gaussian prior shouldincludeasmallcorrectionbasedonthevalueof hΔℎ0 1iforthe modelusedfromTable3.ThestandarderrorontheGaussianpriorfor ℎ0 1 shouldaccountfortheuncertaintiesinthevaluesof 𝑇eﬀ ,log 𝑔and [Fe/H] used to estimate the limb-darkening coeﬃcients, plus some additional error to account for the uncertainty in the correction, plus the scatter around the predicted values (𝜎ext1). The same approach can be used for the Gaussian prior onℎ0 2 but an additional error \u0019\u00060005 should be included to allow for the small systematic error in ℎ0 2 due to diﬀerences in the data pre-processing and data analysis. For example, according to the “Set 1” models from Kostogryz et al. (2022), a star with𝑇eﬀ =6000 \u0006100 K,log 𝑔=40 \u0006005 and »FeH¼=00\u000601 willhave ℎ0 1 =0874\u00060004,ℎ0 2 =0168\u00060004 inthe Keplerband.The empiricalcorrection tothe valueof ℎ0 1 from Table 3 ishΔℎ0 1i= ¸0006 \u00060002 with a scatter𝜎ext1 = 0004. The Gaussian prior to be applied for the analysis of the light curve would then beℎ0 1 =0880 \u00060006. Forℎ0 2, hΔℎ0 2i=\u00000012 \u00060004 with a scatter𝜎ext2 = 0012. The Gaussian prior to be applied for the analysis of the light curve including an additional error of 0.005 to account for uncertainties due to data pre-processing and analysis method diﬀerences would then beℎ0 2 =0156 \u00060014. I have used a Monte Carlo simulation of PLATO light curves to show that limb-darkening will not be a signiﬁcant contribution to the uncertainties in planet radii measured by the PLATO mission provided that the limb-darkening models are carefully selected and calibratedagainstobservationsofrealstarsusingmeasurementssim- ilar to those presented here.

        "main_contributions": "Evaluates accuracy of published limb-darkening predictions by directly measuring limb-darkening from high-S/N Kepler and TESS transit light curves of 43 mostly FGK dwarf exoplanet hosts. Introduces robust, law-agnostic limb-darkening summary parameters h0_1 = I(μ=2/3) and h0_2 = I(2/3) − I(1/3) that are well constrained by transit photometry and avoid ambiguities near the stellar limb. Finds most modern tabulations (ATLAS, MPS-ATLAS, Stagger-grid, PHOENIX-COND) broadly agree with observations but show a small, significant offset in h0_1 (≈ +0.006 in observed−model sense depending on convention) consistent with missing photospheric magnetic-field effects (~100 G). Shows limb-darkening uncertainty is not a limiting error term for PLATO Earth-analog radius precision when priors on h0_1,h0_2 are used and empirically calibrated.",
        "methodology": "Simulates transits using a semi-empirical solar CLV spectrum (Kostogryz et al. 2022) integrated over Kepler response to assess which parts of limb-darkening profile are constrained; fits simulated light curves with Claret 4-parameter law using MCMC (emcee) and PCA-based reparameterization for stable optimization, enforcing physical constraints (0<I(μ)<1 and monotonic). Defines and validates h0_1,h0_2 as low-correlation, well-measured summaries. For real data, models transits with batman + Claret 4-parameter law, sampling posteriors with emcee including an error-scale hyperparameter; derives h0_1,h0_2 from posterior samples. Compares observed h0_1,h0_2 to multiple atmosphere-model tabulations via interpolation in Teff/logg/[Fe/H], estimating mean offsets with an added-scatter (σ_ext) hierarchical likelihood.",
        "experimental_setup": "Targets: 43 transiting exoplanet hosts (Kepler short-cadence KOIs and TESS 2-min targets), mostly FGK dwarfs with Teff<7000 K, high transit S/N (>500 for Kepler), P<30 d (Kepler) or P<10 d with ≥5 sectors (TESS), b<0.8, excluding multi-planet/strong TTV and spot-crossing dominated systems. Stellar params (Teff, logg, [Fe/H]) from SWEET-Cat, preferring Gaia eDR3 logg. Preprocessing: Kepler PDCSAP_FLUX normalized per transit with local linear baseline; phase-binning (180 s median then 60 s mean) with outlier rejection. TESS: similar normalization, no phase-binning; heteroscedastic weighting via MAD in 120 s bins; 3-point exposure integration for 120 s cadence. Validation: transit simulations across impact parameter b; cross-check batman vs ellc at ppm level; robustness tests vs third light (<5%) and mild eccentricity (e<0.1). Model comparisons restricted to b<0.65 to avoid strong h0_1–h0_2 degeneracy. PLATO implication study: 1000-day simulated V=10 solar-like light curve (psls), inject 3 Earth transits 1 year apart, fit with power-2 law and Gaussian priors on h0_1,h0_2 plus 1% stellar-density prior.",
        "limitations": "Sample limited to mostly inactive solar-type hosts with hot Jupiters and adequate short-cadence/2-min data; results may not generalize to very cool stars, hot stars (gravity darkening/pulsations), highly active stars with frequent spot crossings, or grazing/high-b transits (b≳0.65) where h0_1 and h0_2 become strongly correlated. h0_2 shows sensitivity to analysis choices at ~0.01 level (preprocessing/modeling systematics), limiting significance of small model offsets in h0_2. Comparisons depend on accuracy of adopted stellar parameters and linear interpolation in model grids; some model sets only solar metallicity required ad-hoc linear [Fe/H] correction. Magnetic-field explanation is inferred via consistency with MHD simulations and wavelength dependence, not directly measured per star. Uses parametric limb-darkening laws (Claret 4-parameter/polynomial/power-2) rather than direct nonparametric profile recovery; information near μ≲0.2 remains weakly constrained by transits.",
        "future_research_directions": "Extend analysis to larger, more diverse samples (cooler M/K dwarfs, subgiants, higher activity levels) and additional bandpasses (e.g., PLATO, CHEOPS, JWST) to map wavelength- and type-dependent offsets. Incorporate magnetic fields explicitly in atmosphere grids (MHD-informed limb darkening) and test against transit-derived h0_1,h0_2 to quantify field-strength dependence; combine with activity indicators (Ca H&K, photometric variability) to predict corrections per star. Develop hierarchical Bayesian limb-darkening priors directly in (h0_1,h0_2) with systematics terms accounting for preprocessing and spot/facula contamination, including correlated noise models (GPs). Investigate and resolve discrepancies for specific tabulations (notably Neilson & Lester 2013 ATLAS/sATLAS) and understand spherical vs plane-parallel treatment near the limb. Explore nonparametric or basis-function reconstructions of CLV from transits plus other constraints (e.g., interferometry for nearby stars) to better constrain μ≲0.2 behavior.",

    "open_problems": "Prompt-only Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods face a three-way tension that is not well addressed by existing self-consistency or “be brief” prompting: (1) answer correctness, (2) token/latency cost, and (3) *decision stability*—the final answer can flip dramatically across samples because aggregation ignores whether a rationale is internally self-checking or merely confident/verbose. Self-reported confidence is often miscalibrated and can be “gamed,” while length penalties alone may select short but wrong rationales. The key gap is a *prompt-only, model-agnostic* way to estimate which sampled CoTs are both (a) economical and (b) *verifiably consistent with their own intermediate constraints*, without relying on finetuning, external verifiers, or heavy compute.",
    "method": "Refine HESC into **Self-Verified Efficient Consistency (SVEC)**: a two-stage, prompt-only self-consistency that reweights samples by (i) brevity, (ii) *self-verification score* from an automatically elicited check step, and (iii) tempered confidence—while explicitly penalizing contradictions.\n\nAlgorithm (for each problem):\n1) **Generate K candidate solutions** with constrained CoT: “Use ≤N numbered steps; show only essential computations; then provide: `Answer:`”.\n2) **Self-verification prompt (cheap, same model, no tools):** For each candidate, ask the model to restate 2–4 key invariants implied by the problem (units, arithmetic constraints, recomputation of final equation) and to output a structured verdict:\n   - `ChecksPassed: m/M` (integer pass count)\n   - `Contradiction: yes/no`\n   - `Confidence: p` (0–1)\n   This is not a separate verifier model; it is a second prompt that forces *localized, human-like audit* (similar to “check your work”), producing a signal more robust than raw confidence.\n3) **Weighted voting with contradiction penalty:** for each candidate i,\n   - length ℓ_i (tokens)\n   - pass rate r_i = m_i/M_i\n   - contradiction c_i ∈ {0,1}\n   - confidence p_i\n   Weight:\n   w_i = exp( -α·ℓ_i + γ·r_i + β·log(p_i+ε) - δ·c_i )\n   Aggregate answers by sum of weights.\n\nNovelty vs prior prompt-only SC variants: introduces an explicit, structured *self-verification channel* and uses it as an aggregation feature, targeting stability + efficiency rather than accuracy alone. This reduces reliance on potentially dishonest confidence, and operationalizes “human-like economy” as *short reasoning + explicit checklists*.\n\nFeasibility: still prompt-only; only adds an extra model call per sample for verification (or verification can be batched), and aggregation is a small Python script.",
    "experimental_setup": "Datasets (fast, public, Python-evaluable):\n- Primary: GSM8K test first 200 items.\n- Secondary generalization (optional but recommended): SVAMP (first 200) or MultiArith (first 200) to ensure not GSM8K-specific.\n\nBaselines (same model, same sampling budget):\n1) Zero-shot CoT (“Let’s think step by step”), greedy.\n2) Self-Consistency (SC): K samples, majority vote.\n3) HESC (current): length + confidence weighted vote.\n4) SVEC (proposed): length + verification + tempered confidence + contradiction penalty.\n\nFair budget: Fix total generations.

    "expected_conclusion": "SVEC provides a more novel and socially/academically valuable prompt-only CoT improvement by shifting from “more samples” to “human-like self-audit”: it operationalizes economy (short steps) and reliability (explicit checks and contradiction detection) within the self-consistency framework. Unlike confidence- or length-only weighting, SVEC uses a structured self-verification signal that is measurable, ablatable, and model-agnostic, improving correctness and stability while reducing token cost—beneficial for low-latency, lower-carbon deployments and for safer use in education/decision support where uncertainty and internal consistency matter."
